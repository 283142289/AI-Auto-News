      "content": "Shipping containers are seen at Pyeongtaek port in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, April 15, 2025. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo SEOUL, April 24 (Reuters) - When a South Korean delegation meets U.S. counterparts in Washington on Thursday for trade talks, they face a wide range of potential agenda items. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants to hold \"one-stop shopping\" negotiations and has mentioned the trade balance, tariffs, shipbuilding, energy cooperation, and military cost sharing as issues for discussion. The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here. Here are some of the key issues that may be discussed during the South Korea-U.S. trade talks. TARIFFS South Korea faces looming reciprocal tariffs, which Trump set at 25%, as well as item-specific tariffs on products such as steel, autos and semiconductors. It will likely seek to lower the reciprocal tariff rate to the baseline 10%, but may struggle to win exemptions from the item-specific levies. The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement has reduced bilateral tariffs to 0.79% in 2024, but Washington could ask Seoul to lower remaining tariffs on some U.S. agricultural goods such as rice and fruit. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Trump could also target some non-tariff barriers such as South Korean restrictions on genetically modified foods, quarantines for agriculture products, limits on beef, and regulations on tech companies. INVESTMENT South Korea could offer to expand production bases in the United States via Korean companies, including in the automotive, chip and battery sectors. On March 24, Hyundai announced a $20 billion investment for U.S.-based auto and auto parts production through 2028. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The potential tariffs will likely boost back-end fabrication investment in the United States, according to Citi’s semiconductor equity research team. PURCHASES Trump and the U.S. acting ambassador to Seoul, Joseph Yun, have warned that South Korea must reduce its trade surplus with the United States. South Korea is a major buyer of American military exports, including warplanes, and could look to announce more deals. Advertisement · Scroll to continue It could also boost purchases of U.S.-produced energy commodities, agricultural products, and commercial airplanes. In March Boeing and Korean Air touted an upcoming $32.7 billion order for up to 50 widebody airplanes, plus engines and maintenance. ENERGY Trump wants South Korea and other Asian partners to join a $44 billion natural gas export project in Alaska. The project aims to transport gas south from Alaska's remote north via a 1,300-km (800-mile) pipeline, to be shipped as LNG to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, bypassing the Panama Canal. South Korea hosted the Alaska governor and energy officials for talks in March and officials are considering travelling soon to Alaska as part of working-level negotiations on the project. SHIPBUILDING South Korea has said cooperation with Washington in the shipbuilding sector is a \"very important card\" in negotiations. The country's shipyards are expected to potentially benefit from rising demand for tankers, particularly after Trump restricted use of Chinese vessels. South Korea also has contracts for servicing some U.S. Navy ships. Some experts have expressed scepticism, however, that South Korea has the capacity to capitalise on increasing orders. DEFENCE COSTS South Korea hosts about 28,500 American troops as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War. It relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection against China, Russia and North Korea, and is seen as a key ally for projecting U.S. military power. Late last year Seoul signed a new agreement under which it will pay around $1.2 billion toward the upkeep of those U.S. troops in 2026, up 8.3% from 2025. During the campaign Trump said South Korea should pay as much as $10 billion per year, and has said such costs would be part of the negotiations. South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. rose to $56 billion in 2024, up 27% from 2023. ACTING LEADERSHIP The trade talks come as South Korea remains embroiled in its worst political crisis in decades. A snap presidential election will be held on June 3, after former President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and removed from office this month over his failed declaration of martial law. \"We basically expect concrete progress on the negotiations between the Korean and the U.S. government to come out only after the snap presidential election,\" said Oh Suk-tae, an economist at Societe Generale. Oh said it would be especially difficult for South Korea to make any firm commitment on energy projects and defence costs under an acting president. Han has, however, in interviews this month expressed willingness to reach a deal, saying the country will not fight back against Washington as it owes the U.S. for its recovery from the 1950-1953 Korean War. He has also not ruled himself out of contesting the election. \"Should acting president Han Duck-soo appear to successfully negotiate tariff waivers for South Korea, particularly for its auto exports, he would increasingly position himself as a presidential candidate,\" said economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Given how Seoul is competing with other countries and faces a 90-day timeframe before a tariff pause is due to end, he said talks were likely to be extended, and may even result in some form of renegotiated U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Advertisement · Scroll to continue South Korea, a key U.S. ally, has often been singled out by Trump for its trade surpluses with the United States, which hit a record high of $55.6 billion in 2024, up 25% from 2023 and nearly five times higher than in 2019. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun are due to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington, D.C. at 8 a.m. (1200 GMT), on the sidelines of an International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group gathering. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The meeting was arranged at the request of the United States, Seoul said, and comes after U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korea's Acting President Han Duck-soo discussed shipbuilding, energy purchases, an Alaskan gas project and defence payments in a phone call on April 8. \"The government will do its best to find a 'win-win' between the two countries, with focus on three areas of trade balance, shipbuilding and LNG, under the principle that the national interest is the foremost priority,\" Han said on Thursday. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Since the call, South Korean officials have touted shipbuilding as a \"very important card\" it holds. South Korea is the world's second-largest shipbuilder after China, and Trump has specifically called for cooperation in the sector since returning to power. At the same time, Seoul has taken a more cautious stance on the Alaskan gas project, saying participation could be part of a negotiation package, while noting questions about its profitability. South Korea's auto sector is seen as particularly vulnerable to tariffs, as the country's car sales to the United States account for 49% of its total auto exports. The U.S. has already applied 25% tariffs on autos, prompting Seoul to announce emergency support measures to help major exporting companies such as Hyundai Motor and Kia. On the issue of payments for the 28,500 U.S. troops South Korea hosts, Ahn said on Wednesday Seoul was prepared if the issue was brought up, but Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul told lawmakers later it would not be considered for a package deal and should be dealt with separately. In preparation for discussions on non-tariff barriers, Seoul's delegation will include officials from eight different ministries: finance, trade, foreign affairs, technology, transport, environment, agriculture and health. South Korea is among three Asia-Pacific countries that have a comprehensive trade pact with the United States, eliminating nearly all tariffs between the two countries. It was first signed in 2007 but revised in 2018 during Trump's first term after he said the initial agreement was a \"horrible deal\". South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. rose to $56 billion in 2024, up 27% from 2023.

REUTERS/Florence Lo MAOMING, China, April 24 (Reuters) - In Maoming, a southern Chinese city where a giant tilapia statue watches over traffic at an intersection, the fish isn't just a budget-friendly dinner, but a profession, income and way of life for thousands. Today, all of that is at risk from the trade war. The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here. An area roughly one and a half times the size of San Francisco is given over to tilapia farms in Maoming. Fish nurseries and feed lots in turn sustain the farms. Sixteen factories dot the city churning tilapia into fillets for export, much of it to supermarket freezers in the U.S.. Several rounds of U.S. tariffs mean China's $425 million in tilapia exports to the United States are subject to duties of 170%, all but pricing them out of their largest export market. In late April, fish nurseries in Maoming visited by Reuters talked of not getting orders for new fry; feed makers said customers are cutting back. Processors are idle and many farmers say they are making losses at today's prices. Tongwei, one of China's biggest aquaculture businesses, said this month that one-in-10 tilapia farmers in the country could lose their jobs. \"These high tariffs have hit us brutally,\" said Huang Songfei, a longtime buyer in Maoming. \"The whole chain is hurting. People are at risk of losing their jobs.\" Tilapia may be a small segment of trade between the U.S. and China but the threat to livelihoods in Maoming is also being felt in both countries as the trade war throws up massive tariffs on imports. Or, as Huang, put it: \"We're stuck.\" TO BREED OR NOT TO BREED March to May is usually the peak stocking season for tilapia. Recently hatched fish are typically in high demand, swiftly sold and sent off to farmers. This spring, orders are scarce. \"This is the hardest year ever,\" a worker said, asking not to be identified. \"Normally, we'd have sold a lot by now. But no one's buying. Farmers are scared.\" Her boss said sales have fallen by more than half. \"Some aren't even exporting to the U.S., but they are panicking anyway,\" he said, also requesting anonymity. \"It's a chain reaction.\" Tilapia prices crashed 17% in early April as Washington and Beijing traded tariff blows. Despite a modest recovery, prices are dangerously low and some farmers are struggling to make ends meet, Huang said. The city's 16 export processors are also struggling. They once exported about 100,000 tonnes of tilapia a year, mostly to the United States and Canada, according to the local government, enough to satisfy the average annual fish intake of 25 million Americans. \"If this keeps going, everyone will go bankrupt,\" said Zhu Huazhi, a buyer for several processing plants. More than 60% of their tilapia once went to the U.S.. SEARCHING FOR A LIFELINE In nearby Hainan province, the U.S. accounts for half of its tilapia exports and the local aquatic products' association urged companies this month to find new markets at home and abroad. However, replacing American demand is difficult. While markets exist in the European Union, Africa and the Middle East - they can't quickly or completely replace U.S demand. Africa, for example, largely imports whole fish with minimal processing, according to a tilapia exporter. The domestic economy is no easy fix either. The local market is weak, consumers are cautious and spending is slow. In Maoming, people are pinning their hopes on a trade deal. \"We'll see who can survive this,\" Zhu said. \"I believe in China's economy. If the tariffs are resolved, orders will come back.\" ($1=7.2995 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Ella Cao, Xiaoyu Yin and Florence Lo in Maoming; Editing by Lewis Jackson and Neil Fullick Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"

      "content": "A Boeing 737 MAX 8, the second jet intended for use by a Chinese airline to be returned to its manufacturer, lands at Boeing Field, as trade tensions escalate over U.S. tariffs with China, in Seattle, Washington, U.S. April 22, 2025. REUTERS/David Ryder SEOUL, April 24 (Reuters) - Boeing's (BA.N) , opens new tab Chinese customers are refusing delivery of new planes built for them due to tariffs, the U.S. planemaker has confirmed, as a third Boeing jet started returning to the U.S. on Thursday. \"Due to the tariffs, many of our customers in China have indicated that they will not take delivery,\" CEO Kelly Ortberg said during a first quarter earnings call on Wednesday. The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here. Ortberg said China was the only country where Boeing was facing this issue and the planemaker would redirect new jet supply to other customers eager for earlier deliveries due to a global shortage of new commercial planes. Before President Donald Trump's global trade offensive, commercial jets were traded duty-free worldwide under a 1979 civil aviation agreement. A Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet could now be hit hard by the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Beijing on the import of U.S. goods. A new 737 MAX has a market value of around $55 million, according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. Two 737 MAX 8s, which had been ferried to China in March for delivery to Xiamen Airlines, returned to Boeing's production hub in Seattle in the past week. A third 737 MAX 8 left Boeing's Zhoushan completion centre near Shanghai for the U.S. territory of Guam on Thursday, data from flight trackers AirNav Radar and Flightradar24 showed. The plane was initially built for national carrier Air China (601111.SS) , opens new tab , according to the Aviation Flights Group tracking database. Air China did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It had been ferried from Seattle on April 5, in the period between Trump first announcing tariffs on China and Beijing starting to enforce its own ramped up tariffs on U.S. goods. Guam is one of the stops such flights make on the 5,000-mile (8,000-km) journey across the Pacific between Seattle and Zhoushan, where planes are ferried by Boeing for final work and delivery to a Chinese carrier. The Chinese government has not commented on why the planes were being returned. ORDER BOOK CFO Brian West said that China represents around 10% of Boeing's backlog of commercial planes. Boeing had planned to deliver around 50 new planes to China during the rest of the year, West said, and was assessing options for re-marketing the 41 already built or in-process airplanes. \"For the nine airplanes not yet in the production system, we're engaged with our customers to understand their intentions for taking delivery and if necessary, we have the ability to assign those positions to other customers,\" Ortberg said. \"We're not going to continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them,\" Ortberg said. Tracking data from Aviation Flights Group shows 36 built aircraft for Chinese customers at various stages of production and testing are now in the U.S., including the three returned planes. Boeing data shows 130 unfilled orders for China-based airlines and lessors, including 96 of its best-selling 737 MAX model. Industry sources say a significant portion of the more than 760 unfilled orders for which Boeing has yet to name a buyer are for China. The tariff war comes as Boeing has been recovering from an almost five-year import freeze on 737 MAX jets into China and a previous round of trade tensions. West said the issue is a short-term challenge, and that either China starts taking planes again, or Boeing prepares the jets for re-marketing. \"Customers are calling, asking for additional airplanes,\" he said. Washington signalled openness to de-escalating the trade war this week, stating that high tariffs between the United States and China are not sustainable. However, analysts say that confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs suggesting they would defer plane delivery rather than pay duties.
