    "content": "Music samples group Splice will buy London-based Spitfire Audio for its library of orchestral sounds Splice’s library of samples include the guitar riff used in Sabrina Carpenter’s ‘Espresso’’ © Samir Hussein/WireImage via Getty Images (Image: Sabrina Carpenter performing at the Brit Awards 2025 in March 2025 in London, England) Music creation start-up Splice has agreed to acquire the orchestral sound studio Spitfire Audio for about $50mn, as the Goldman Sachs backed company looks to buy up audio samples and technology to build songs using artificial intelligence. London-based Spitfire Audio owns a deep library of digital orchestral sounds — short recordings of violins, cellos, drums and basses that composers can use to create music. Its palette of sounds, such as a $299 drum kit recorded by composer Hans Zimmer, have been used in Radiohead songs and in the scores for films such as Moonlight. Splice is a platform that offers audio samples — such as vocal hooks, drum beats and guitar riffs — for anyone, ranging from novices to professional producers, to create music. The group was founded in 2013 and has grown quickly as it benefits from soaring demand for music creation tools. Splice is profitable, reaching annual revenue of more than $100mn and 600,000 paying subscribers, according to people familiar with the matter. Splice and Spitfire declined to disclose the price of the deal. A person familiar with the matter said it was about $50mn. The rise of platforms like Splice reflects the changing nature of music production. As software production tools have become more sophisticated, anyone can create music from their bedroom. Splice and Spitfire offer sounds that are often just a few seconds long, in repeated loops that can be layered with other instrumentals or vocals to build out a song. Hit songs have used samples from the Splice library that can be downloaded for as little as $13. The samples include the guitar riff used in Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” — the guitar loop and drum sounds were created by Vaughn Oliver, a DJ whose samples are popular on Splice. Other hits, such as Doja Cat’s “Say So” and Playboi Carti’s “OPM Babi”, have also used Splice samples. Splice was valued at nearly $500mn in a 2021 fundraising led by Goldman Sachs and entrepreneur Matt Pincus’s investment group MUSIC. Spitfire has a library of “super high-end, incredibly luxurious rich sounds, recording with the BBC Symphony Orchestra or Abbey Roads Studio”, said Splice chief executive Kakul Srivastava. She also wanted to acquire the underlying audio technology and talent that Spitfire has built, she said. Splice has been rolling out AI technology to help musicians build songs, using algorithms to suggest samples based on a genre, mood or even singing into your mobile phone. Pincus says this AI element has led to “explosive” growth for Splice in the past few months, calling it a “land grab” in the still nascent market. All of the sounds on Splice are initially created by humans. The group has its own in-house artists who record samples, but it also scours the world for cutting-edge trends from different genres, such as funk artists in São Paulo or K-Pop musicians in Seoul. Splice pays these artists a percentage of its subscription revenue. Srivastava says Splice is looking to do something fundamentally different from the prompt-based AI song generators that have popped up in the past few years and fuelled backlash in the music industry. “Simplistic tools where you type in a prompt and a song comes out? Most musicians do not want to make music that way,” she said. “But AI will enable [artists] to do things they could not do today. They could use string quartets from Spitfire, but you might want to invent your own instrument. You can start with a particular sound and merge instruments together to get a novel sound that has never been heard before . . . we are still figuring it out.”",

    "title": "Berlin faces EU test over German electricity market break-up",
    "time": "2 hours ago",
    "content": "Sweden, Belgium and Czech Republic argue country’s market restructuring could drive prices down The German electricity industry is struggling with high energy prices and low European demand © Alexandra Beier/Reuters (Image: High-voltage power lines and electricity pylons are pictured during sunset) Germany’s new government faces an early test of its sway in Brussels as it defies pressure from neighbouring countries to break up the German electricity market. Sweden, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among countries to have argued that splitting the large German market into several zones could lower prices for their consumers, as electricity flows to the region of highest priced demand. Europe’s grid operators on Monday are set to publish a report that could recommend the split — a measure that was successfully implemented in Sweden. Stockholm has said that it was only prepared to approve a power cable connecting Germany to southern Sweden if Berlin also reorganises its electricity market. But the German industry, already struggling with high energy prices and low European demand, has strongly opposed changes to the country’s energy market, amid fears that it would drive up prices for the heavily industrialised south. The EU grid operators’ umbrella organisation (Entsoe) will publish its recommendations on Monday. The body is expected to push for a division of the German market into either two or three zones, according to people with knowledge of the process. If Berlin refuses to restructure its market and other member states insist on the split, the European Commission could take charge of the process — potentially pitting the administration of incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz against his former party colleague, Ursula von der Leyen, who is now the commission’s president. Studies done by the Commission show it prefers a break-up, one EU official said. Entsoe delayed its report by several months, as Berlin balked at the prospect of having to restructure its power market. In 2022, the EU energy regulator Acer put forward several scenarios on how to split the German market, saying such a move would reduce bottlenecks and help connect renewable power sources to the grid. “If you’re talking about energy security in terms of how to make Europe’s power grids more efficient and stable you really need to split Germany into a north and south power zone,” said Henning Gloystein, director of climate, energy and resources at Eurasia Group. Entsoe declined to comment on the contents of the report. EU diplomats from Germany’s other neighbouring countries have also said they would favour a break-up. “We don’t want to piss off Germany, but de facto yes [we favour a split] — not as a matter of principle but because it would make the EU market more efficient and better functioning,” said one EU diplomat. Early drafts of the new German coalition agreement adopted earlier this month signalled openness to reconfiguring the electricity market. But the final document said Berlin would stick to the current structure, in place since 2007, in a bid to lower energy prices and help industry. Some of Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU) are more open to the idea, but admit it would hard to pull off in the current environment. Christian Ehler, a CDU lawmaker from northern Germany, said electricity bills were paradoxically higher in regions that had a lot of cheap renewable energy. A split would be “economically and physically the best option to reduce redispatch costs”, Ehler said, but the resulting disruption “might not be the best option at the moment”. Gloystein said the influence of Germany’s regional governments, with the richer ones in the south balancing the budgets or poorer ones in the north, was “so insurmountable that the federal government would prefer to be told off by the Swedes than deal with the Bundesländer”. Matthias Belitz, head of energy at the German chemical lobby VCI, warned that splitting Germany’s pricing zones would create “massive uncertainty” and further hit the country’s already struggling chemical sector. “Splitting the electricity bidding zone would be tantamount to a complete reorganisation of the electricity market, which would take many years,” he said. “A lack of planning security and reliability is the complete opposite of what companies need in the current difficult situation.” Renewables investors, particularly in wind farms, back the position of heavy industry, arguing that dividing Germany into two or three zones undermines their investment case. “If you want to build a wind farm today in Germany you make a calculation about future revenues,” said Giles Dickson, chief executive of WindEurope. “Today you base those calculations on Germany being one single wholesale electricity market with one single price.” Bernd Weber, managing director of German think-tank EPICO KlimaInnovation, said it was possible to balance the conflicting interests through compensation. “But unfortunately we are not having this discussion,” he said, as his government was opposing the split.

    "title": "China’s clean tech exports to emerging markets surged in 2024, data shows",
    "time": "2 hours ago",
    "content": "Focus on exports to developing markets expected to rise further on back of US tariffs Emerging markets accounted for 43% of Chinese clean tech exports in 2024, up from 24% in 2022, according to BloombergNEF © CFOTO via Reuters Connect (Image: Workers in a digital workshop in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China, are engaged in the production of solar photovoltaic products) China has rapidly scaled up sales of solar panels, batteries and other green energy technologies to emerging markets well ahead of the US tariff fight, latest data shows, with expectations it will surge further in its hunt for buyers. Emerging markets accounted for 43 per cent of Chinese clean tech exports in 2024, up from 24 per cent in 2022, in a sign of how the manufacturing powerhouse is seeking out new markets, according to new figures from BloombergNEF, the data provider. Falling prices at the same time made the green energy products more affordable in developing countries. China’s focus on exports to emerging markets would intensify on the back of “extreme levels of tariffs” from the US — now standing at 145 per cent for Chinese goods — as well as growing trade barriers from the EU and elsewhere, said Antoine Vagneur-Jones, head of trade and supply chains at BNEF. “We don’t think that we’ve reached anywhere the levels of penetration, the volumes of exports [to emerging markets] that we could be seeing,” he added. The data follows a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping at a UN-convened virtual meeting of world leaders this week, when he declared that “no matter how the international situation changes, China will not slow down its efforts to address climate change”. Countries should “boost technological innovation and industrial transformation through co-operation, and facilitate the free flow of quality green technologies and products, so that they can be accessible, affordable and beneficial for all countries, especially developing ones”, Xi said. The Chinese leader committed his country to an improved climate target by the time of the next UN climate summit this year, covering all sectors and greenhouse gas emissions, without giving any further details. “Since I announced China’s goals for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality five years ago, we have built the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain,” he said. The comments came amid concerns that a trade war could hamper efforts to cut emissions. Ana Toni, chief executive of the UN COP30 climate summit to be held in Brazil this year, recently said a trade war would hit the world’s ability to tackle rising temperatures by limiting access to technology. But the rising sales of Chinese goods into emerging markets could also be beneficial for global efforts to tackle climate change, said Vagneur-Jones. China’s rapid shift into emerging markets has helped drive a solar boom in energy-starved countries such as Pakistan and Lebanon, as well onshore wind development in Uzbekistan, and electric vehicles in Brazil, he added. Last year, the value of global clean energy imports shrank for the first time, down 7 per cent to $409bn, mainly driven by falling prices for solar and battery technology, BNEF said. Vagneur-Jones said this fall in value was despite overall volumes remaining steady or rising for various technologies. BNEF found that more than three-quarters of all new investments globally into green tech manufacturing was in China last year. While President Donald Trump argued that US tariffs would help bring manufacturing onshore, overcapacity in China was driving down global prices for green tech and making it harder for other countries to develop their own supply chains, said Vagneur-Jones. This oversupply would continue for years, BNEF predicted, with its risk-adjusted forecast finding that supply will outpace demand until at least 2027, especially in solar and battery manufacturing. “This is going to be a double-edged sword. It means that you’ve got a readily available supply of high-quality, low-cost technology that is vital to decarbonising industries and economies across the world . . . which is good news,” he said. “And then the bad news is that this makes it extremely difficult to do any of this onshoring [by other governments].”",
    "zh_body": "数据显示，中国清洁技术出口到新兴市场在 2024 年激增 随着美国关税的推波助澜，预计对发展中市场的出口将进一步增长 彭博新能源财经 (BloombergNEF) 的最新数据显示，中国向新兴市场销售太阳能电池板、电池和其他绿色能源技术的速度远超美国关税战爆发之前，预计在寻求买家的过程中，销售量还将进一步激增。根据数据提供商彭博新能源财经 (BloombergNEF) 的最新数据，新兴市场在 2024 年占中国清洁技术出口的 43%，高于 2022 年的 24%，这表明这个制造业强国正在寻找新市场。与此同时，价格的下降使得绿色能源产品在发展中国家更容易负担。彭博新能源财经贸易和供应链负责人 Antoine Vagneur-Jones 表示，鉴于美国“极端水平的关税”（目前对中国商品征收 145% 的关税），以及欧盟和其他地区日益增长的贸易壁垒，中国将更加关注对新兴市场的出口。他补充说：“我们认为我们还没有达到我们可能看到的新兴市场渗透率和出口量水平。”此数据发布之前，中国国家主席习近平本周在联合国召集的全球领导人虚拟会议上发表讲话，宣布“无论国际形势如何变化，中国都不会放慢应对气候变化的努力”。习近平表示，各国应“通过合作促进技术创新和产业转型，促进优质绿色技术和产品的自由流动，使其能够惠及所有国家，特别是发展中国家，并使其更容易获得和负担得起”。这位中国领导人承诺，在今年举行的下一次联合国气候峰会之前，中国将提高其气候目标，涵盖所有部门和温室气体排放，但未提供进一步细节。他说：“自从我五年前宣布中国碳达峰和碳中和目标以来，我们已经建成了全球最大、增长最快的可再生能源体系，以及最大、最完整的新能源产业链。”这些评论是在人们担心贸易战可能阻碍减排努力之际发表的。今年将在巴西举行的联合国 COP30 气候峰会执行秘书 Ana Toni 最近表示，贸易战将限制技术的获取，从而影响全球应对气温上升的能力。但 Vagneur-Jones 表示，中国商品在新兴市场销售的增长也可能有利于全球应对气候变化的努力。他补充说，中国在新兴市场的快速转移帮助巴基斯坦和黎巴嫩等能源短缺的国家推动了太阳能的繁荣，乌兹别克斯坦的陆上风电发展，以及巴西的电动汽车发展。彭博新能源财经表示，去年，全球清洁能源进口价值首次萎缩，下降 7% 至 4090 亿美元，这主要由太阳能和电池技术价格下跌推动。Vagneur-Jones 表示，尽管各种技术的总体销量保持稳定或增长，但价值却下降了。彭博新能源财经发现，去年全球对绿色技术制造的新投资中有超过四分之三在中国。虽然唐纳德·特朗普总统认为美国关税有助于将制造业带回国内，但中国的产能过剩正在压低全球绿色技术价格，并使其他国家更难发展自己的供应链，说。彭博新能源财经预测，这种供应过剩将持续多年，其风险调整后的预测显示，供应将至少在 2027 年之前超过需求，特别是在太阳能和电池制造领域。“这将是一把双刃剑。这意味着你拥有现成的高质量、低成本技术供应，这对全球各行各业和经济体的脱碳至关重要……这是个好消息。”“而坏消息是，这使得（其他政府）进行任何此类本土化变得极其困难。”"

    "time": "2 hours ago",
    "content": "The deployment of such aircraft on the battlefield is ‘not far off’, says Munich-based Stark Stark’s OWE-V drone can launch vertically and strike targets up to 100km away © Frederik Watzka (Image: A Stark drone) The era of fully automated strike drones are within technological reach, according to German drone start-up Stark, as the race to develop weapons capable of selecting and striking targets independently heats up. The war in Ukraine has accelerated investment in drone technology, with some companies touting their precision and lethality at a fraction of the cost of tanks or missiles. Many unmanned systems can already navigate autonomously and track moving targets, but Philip Lockwood, managing director of Munich-based Stark, said the deployment of next generation drones — that do not require human approval to pick and hit targets — was “not far off”. While the EU has expressed support for banning fully autonomous weapons, it has yet to legislate on the issue, and efforts to reach an international treaty through the UN have made slow progress. But Lockwood, who previously headed innovation at Nato, warned other regions may have fewer qualms about deploying such weapons. “I think that we should be concerned that our adversaries like Russia and China [ . . .] are not going to have concerns about how these systems are used,” he said. The warning comes amid the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence on the battlefield in Ukraine, where many systems use autonomous navigation and AI software to chart their own paths, resist jamming, and track moving targets. US-based Anduril has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries from the rising demand for new technologies. Hundreds of its Altius-600M drones have been bought by the Pentagon and sent to Ukraine’s front-line. Other companies include Turkey’s drone manufacturer Baykar. Stark’s OWE-V drone embeds software that allows it to make real-time decisions to avoid other warfare systems (Image: Stark’s OWE-V drone) In Europe, aside from Munich-based rival Helsing and reconnaissance drone maker Quantum Systems — founded by Florian Seidel, who is also behind Stark — start-ups in the space that have been trying to raise their profile include Tekever, which builds drones for intelligence and surveillance. Stark’s first drone launched last week, the OWE-V, embeds software that allows it to make real-time decisions to avoid other warfare systems. It can also launch vertically and strike targets up to 100km away. Lockwood said the company had controls in place to ensure a human was “in the loop” on any decisions made. “We’re not comfortable at this stage reducing those controls,” he said. Traditional arms manufacturers have pushed back against their new rivals’ claims that drones — which can cost as little as a few thousand euros to hundreds of thousands — will allow governments to replace some big-ticket arms expenditure. “Drones are not a game-changer. The current discussion suggests that drones alone can win a war — that is definitely not true,” Armin Papperger, chief executive of munitions maker Rheinmetall said last month. But drone start-ups are confident they can tap into rapidly growing defence expenditure in Europe. Stark, which also has offices in Berlin and Kyiv, does not see a threat to its business from a potential end to the Ukraine war, and the daily destruction of weapons on European soil. “There is going to be a distrust of Russia for many, many, many long years — potentially generations,” Lockwood said.",

    "time": "2 hours ago",
    "content": "US oil major’s $30bn plan depends on Trump administration retaining Biden-era tax incentives Exxon has invested billions of dollars in a hydrogen plant at its Baytown refinery in Texas © Mark Felix for The Washington Post via Getty Images (Image: Aerial view of the ExxonMobil Baytown refinery in Baytown, Texas, with residential homes and construction equipment in the foreground) ExxonMobil, which once derided European rivals’ clean energy investments as a “beauty contest” that would do little to halt climate change, is poised to leapfrog Shell and BP in low carbon spending. Investment guidance issued by six of the largest western oil majors shows that Exxon plans to spend $30bn on “low emissions opportunities” between now and 2030 — far higher than its $3bn spending plan announced in 2021. The US oil major defines low carbon spending as investment aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and has focused on technologies such as carbon capture, biofuels, hydrogen and lithium extraction. Unlike its European rivals it has not built a large renewable energy business. The stepped-up investment plan from Exxon comes just as European rivals that ploughed cash into clean energy in recent years begin scaling back their investments under pressure from investors. Data compiled by Wood Mackenzie, an energy research group, shows that Shell, BP and Equinor have slashed their guidance for low carbon spending to focus on more profitable fossil fuel production. It marks a surprising turn for Exxon, which has drawn much criticism from climate activists for continuing to increase fossil fuel output — and lobbying against restrictions — despite knowing they were causing global warming. In February, BP — which proclaimed itself a green energy leader in 2020 — cut its annual guidance on low carbon spending to $1.75bn, down from $6.45bn, and far below Exxon’s $5bn a year. Shell has cut its proposed low carbon investments to $3.5bn a year, from $5.58bn. Norway’s Equinor has reduced its annual guidance from $3.9bn to $2.3bn, according to Wood Mackenzie, which has analysed company data issued between 2023 to 2025. TotalEnergies remains a leader in low carbon investment with $5bn annual spending guidance in 2025, although the company disclosed in January it would spend $4.5bn in 2025. The French group plans to spend 29 per cent of its total budget on low carbon projects, compared with 17 per cent for Exxon and Shell. BP plans to spend 12 per cent following its recent cuts. Scatter plot chart showing that Exxon overtakes BP and Shell on low carbon guidance (Image: Scatter plot chart showing that Exxon overtakes BP and BP on low carbon guidance) “ExxonMobil’s low carbon strategy is gaining momentum at a time when some peers are scaling back ambitions,” said Tom Ellacott, senior vice-president at Wood Mackenzie’s corporate research division. “The company is focusing on technologies in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and has built an attractive pipeline of opportunities in low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and lithium.” But Ellacott said there was uncertainty over whether Exxon would deliver on its spending guidance, which relies on US government subsidies and customer demand. Exxon has said investment in some of its low carbon projects, including a multibillion-dollar hydrogen plant at its Baytown refinery in Texas, depends on tax breaks in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act — the flagship climate law President Donald Trump has vowed to rescind. “It’s important for these nascent businesses and industries to get some initial support,” Kathy Mikells, Exxon’s chief financial officer, told the Financial Times in January. Analysts and climate groups said comparing oil producers’ low carbon spending was complex as definitions can differ between companies. “There are two aspects of low carbon spending. The first is spend to decarbonise the existing asset base, so-called scope 1 and 2. The European majors typically include this spend in their divisional budgets, upstream and downstream, whereas Exxon and Chevron include this in their low carbon spending,” said Biraj Borkhataria, global head of energy transition research at RBC. This could account for about half of Exxon’s spending and 20 per cent of Chevron’s, he said. Exxon told the FT that almost 65 per cent of its low carbon investment would be spent on reducing emissions for its customers. Chevron, which plans to trim its low carbon budget this year by $500mn to $1.5bn, did not reply to a request for comment. Follow This, a shareholder activist group that clashed with Exxon last year over climate policy, said the oil producer could not be considered a leader because it was not including the pollution from its customers burning its oil and gas — so-called scope 3 emissions. Even so, analysts say there has been a step change in Exxon’s strategy since chief executive Darren Woods told analysts in 2020 that he sought to avoid a “beauty competition” with rivals on carbon emissions. “Exxon is leaning into these areas not because of environmental social governance or sustainability initiatives but rather genuine business opportunities where XOM has a competitive advantage and the ability to scale,” said Betty Jiang, analyst at Barclays. Shell said Wood Mackenzie’s data overlooked the “scale of our historical investments in the low carbon space”. Environmental Defense Fund, a climate group, said Exxon had increased its low carbon spending — but not enough. “It’s still woefully short of the kind of capital that needs to deploy if we’re going to make major progress in decarbonising our collective economies in the next 30 years,” said EDF’s Mark Brownstein.",

    "time": "3 hours ago",
    "content": "Data shows younger staff — more than baby boomers — crave the connection and routine of in-person work Rosie Labbett, who commutes to her job in wholesale catering four days a week, says that she sees value in meeting colleagues in real life © Charlie Bibby/FT Rosie Labbett is an office evangelist. The 21-year-old, who works in wholesale catering, finds the moments chatting before a meeting invaluable — starkly different to logging on to Teams calls. “Ideas and creativity thrive,” she says. “Personal relationships are so important . . . More people should see the value in connecting with others in real life.” Contrary to some stereotypes Generation Z, the cohort born between 1997 and 2012, is leading the charge back to the office, while older generations are more reluctant to return to past patterns of presenteeism. Workers under 24 years old are more likely to be in the office than their older counterparts, according to research by property group JLL: on average coming in 3.1 days a week, while other age groups put in between 2.5 and 2.7 days. Mandated office returns are partly being justified on the grounds of young people needing time working in-person. Comments on remote working from Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, were leaked this year. “The young generation is being damaged by this,” he said. “They’re being left behind socially, ideas, meeting people.” Other leaders have expressed concern that the old apprentice model, of learning by listening, is deteriorating due to homeworking. Generational disparities can create challenges for managers, who must balance competing demands for flexibility from older workers who have existing networks and caring responsibilities, with younger peers’ desire to learn and meet colleagues. It highlights some of the difficulties for a generation that spent part of their education in lockdown. Bryan Berthold, global lead of workplace experience at Cushman & Wakefield, the property group, says a gap in office attendance between older and younger workers can lead to lower satisfaction among junior staff. Commuters in the City of London financial district. Some younger workers argue that the absence of older managers from the workplace makes travelling into the office feel pointless © Tolga Akmen/EPA-EFE-Shutterstock (Image: Commuters in the City of London financial district) Lucy Blitz, a 22-year-old content producer at Two Circles, a sports marketing agency, finds relationships easier to build in-person: “Actually being able to speak to my colleagues and managers face to face if there’s an issue is easier than communicating over Slack, which I can’t stand.” One 23-year-old finance worker, who asked to be anonymous, says the absence of older managers makes going into the office feel pointless. “Why would I, as a young person with student debt, say goodbye to around a quarter of my salary just on trains and the occasional coffee?” For Johnnie Dowd, a 22-year-old strategy analyst at British Land, one motivation to work in the office is his small flat, where the kitchen table serves as a desk. “It’s not the right height and I basically end up hunching over my laptop, whereas I can go into the office, have a huge desk with all these monitors and a really well-regulated temperature.” Dowd says he wants to “interact and be social . . . my vision of my twenties is not being sat at home with lots of Zoom calls.” The needs of these younger workers are prompting creative responses from some employers, says Brian Elliott, chief executive of consultancy Work Forward. He knows of companies hiring junior staff in fewer locations “in order to build larger cohorts . . . so they get more social connection [and] support”. One company launched a programme whereby managers set “anchor days” to attend the office with a daily minimum hour-long open time for their reports to drop by with questions. More common, however, is the introduction of company-wide mandates demanding all staff in the office for all or part of the week. Elliott says leaders are “concerned about the professional development of younger workers if they don’t get enough time with managers and mentors broadly. That’s understandable.” However, he believes increasing office attendance will not necessarily mean more management time. “Often the same managers have little training, and in the past few years firms have laid off layers of managers to expand ‘spans of control’ for six to eight direct reports to 10 to 16. The odds of junior staff getting a lot of hands-on feedback don’t go up if the manager has double the team and still their own workload.” Berthold says blanket office mandates can make young people feel they are not trusted. “You’ve let the cat out of the bag — it’s like going from high school to college, no one’s checking in on you. The mandates are like going back to high school. It’s hard to build trust.” While young people are more enthusiastic about the office, survey responses suggest they also appreciate flexibility. The JLL report, which questioned more than 12,000 employees across industries and countries, found the youngest workers said their ideal number of days was 2.6 — lower than the days they actually spent in the office but higher than 35- to 44-year-olds who wanted just 2.1 It also found workers under the age of 34 prioritized work-life balance and flexibility, while over-55s were more “sensitive to physical conditions like temperature, noise, and air quality”. A survey by Deloitte found 26 per cent of Gen Zs felt more engaged and connected to their organisation as a result of their employer mandating at least part-time office work, but 18 per cent thought being forced back meant their productivity had decreased. A further 21 per cent of Gen Zs “believe being required on-site full time or on some days has negatively impacted them in a financial sense”. Even office fan Labbett appreciates working from home some days: she heads to the office four days a week. A hybrid arrangement “encourages a trusting relationship between the employer and the employee”, she says, but “when the trust is misused” things can get difficult. Heejung Chung, professor of work and employment at King’s College London, says employers need to think about how different generations work together in the office, not just insist they show up. Managers need to get better at planning group workshops, coaching and brainstorming in-person, otherwise time in the office is spent “having Zoom meetings”. Creating social moments helps young people “feel embedded in the company”, she says. Contrary to work-shy stereotypes and memes encouraging “quiet quitting”, Mark Dixon, founder and chief executive of office group IWG, says Gen Z are “not only rapidly rising as a demographic of substantial influence, but are incredibly hard working” and “expect a healthy balance between their professional lives and their personal pursuits”. Interest in navigating white-collar workplaces partly explains a rise in office-related social media content. Jemima Grace, a risk consultant, is one of many Gen Z workers making TikTok videos about life in a corporate job. They feature office outfits, preparing for networking events, and “get ready with me” morning routines. Grace recently posted a #corporategirlies “day in the life”, recording getting the Tube at 7.20am, arriving at the office at 8.15am, before answering Teams messages, having lunch at her desk, reading a proposal and creating a presentation, before leaving at 6pm. It was played 4mn times and generated 180,000 likes, far outstripping her normal content. Grace believes such posts help Gen Z navigate the workplace. “Young people think, ‘What the hell am I supposed to do?’ People on TikTok are younger, and don’t know what [the office routine] is like.” However, she was surprised by some of the reaction. There were “lots of comments saying, ‘Thank god I don’t do this.’ Others said I looked unhappy.”",
    "zh_body": "数据显示，年轻员工（比婴儿潮一代）更渴望面对面工作的联系和日常 Rosie Labbett 每周有四天通勤上班，从事批发餐饮工作，她说她看到与同事在现实生活中见面的价值 © Charlie Bibby/FT Rosie Labbett 是一个办公室福音传道者。这位 21 岁的年轻人在批发餐饮行业工作，她发现会议前聊天的时刻非常宝贵——这与登录 Teams 通话截然不同。她说：“创意和创造力蓬勃发展。”“人际关系非常重要……更多人应该看到在现实生活中与他人建立联系的价值。”与某些刻板印象相反，Z 世代（出生于 1997 年至 2012 年之间的人群）正引领着重返办公室的潮流，而老一辈人则更不愿回到过去的打卡模式。根据房地产集团 JLL 的研究，24 岁以下的员工比年龄较大的同事更可能在办公室：他们平均每周来办公室 3.1 天，而其他年龄段的员工则在 2.5 天到 2.7 天之间。强制重返办公室的部分理由是年轻人需要面对面工作的时间。摩根大通首席执行官 Jamie Dimon 今年关于远程办公的评论被泄露。他说：“年轻一代正因此受到伤害。”“他们在社交、思想和人际交往方面被落下。”其他领导者也表达了担忧，认为传统的学徒模式（通过听讲学习）由于在家工作而正在退化。代际差异可能给管理者带来挑战，他们必须平衡拥有现有社交网络和照顾责任的年长员工对灵活性的不同需求，以及年轻同事学习和与同事见面的愿望。这凸显了部分教育在封锁中度过的这一代人面临的一些困难。房地产集团 Cushman & Wakefield 全球工作场所体验负责人 Bryan Berthold 表示，年长员工和年轻员工之间在办公室出勤率上的差距可能导致初级员工满意度降低。伦敦金融城的通勤者。一些年轻员工认为，年长管理者不在工作场所使得通勤上班变得毫无意义 © Tolga Akmen/EPA-EFE-Shutterstock（图片：伦敦金融城的通勤者） 22 岁的体育营销机构 Two Circles 内容制作人 Lucy Blitz 发现，面对面建立关系更容易：“如果遇到问题，能够真正与我的同事和经理面对面交流，比通过 Slack 交流更容易，我实在受不了 Slack。”一位不愿透露姓名的 23 岁金融从业者表示，年长管理者不在办公室使得去办公室变得毫无意义。“作为一个负有助学贷款的年轻人，我为什么要将大约四分之一的薪水仅仅花在火车票和偶尔的咖啡上呢？”对于 22 岁的英国土地公司战略分析师 Johnnie Dowd 来说，去办公室工作的一个动机是他的小公寓，厨房桌子就充当书桌。“高度不对，我基本上都是弓着身子对着笔记本电脑，而我可以去办公室，那里有巨大的办公桌、所有这些显示器以及调节得很好的温度。”Dowd 说他想“互动和社交……我二十几岁的愿景不是坐在家里开很多 Zoom 会议。”咨询公司 Work Forward 首席执行官 Brian Elliott 表示，这些年轻员工的需求正促使一些雇主做出创造性的回应。他知道有些公司在较少的地点招聘初级员工，“以便建立更大的群体……这样他们可以获得更多的社交联系和支持”。一家公司启动了一个项目，经理们设定“固定日”，与下属一起在办公室工作，并设定每日至少一小时的开放时间，供下属带着问题来访。然而，更常见的是引入公司范围内的强制规定，要求所有员工每周全部或部分时间在办公室工作。Elliott 表示，领导者“担心年轻员工的职业发展，如果他们没有足够的时间与管理者和导师广泛接触的话。这是可以理解的。”然而，他认为增加办公室出勤率不一定意味着更多的管理时间。“通常，同样的管理者几乎没有接受过培训，而且在过去几年里，公司已经裁减了多层管理者，将‘管理跨度’从六到八名直接下属扩大到 10 到 16 名。如果管理者团队规模翻倍，并且自己的工作量仍然很大，那么初级员工获得大量实践反馈的可能性并不会增加。”Berthold 说，一刀切的办公室规定会让年轻人觉得不受信任。“你已经放出了笼中的猫——这就像从高中升入大学，没有人监督你。这些规定就像回到了高中。建立信任很难。”虽然年轻人对办公室更加热情，但调查回复表明他们也看重灵活性。JLL 的报告调查了来自不同行业和国家的 12,000 多名员工，发现最年轻的员工表示他们理想的每周办公天数是 2.6 天——低于他们实际在办公室的天数，但高于 35 至 44 岁希望只有 2.1 天的员工。报告还发现，34 岁以下的员工优先考虑工作与生活的平衡和灵活性，而 55 岁以上的员工对“温度、噪音和空气质量等物理条件更敏感”。德勤的一项调查发现，26% 的 Z 世代员工认为，雇主强制至少部分时间在办公室工作提高了他们对组织的参与度和归属感，但 18% 的人认为被迫回办公室降低了他们的工作效率。另有 21% 的 Z 世代员工“认为被要求全职或部分天数在现场工作在经济上对他们产生了负面影响”。即使是办公室爱好者 Labbett 也喜欢在家工作几天：她每周有四天去办公室。她表示，混合安排“鼓励雇主和员工之间建立信任关系”，但“当信任被滥用时”，事情可能会变得困难。伦敦国王学院工作与就业学教授 Heejung Chung 表示，雇主需要思考不同世代如何在办公室协同工作，而不仅仅是坚持要求他们到场。管理者需要更好地规划面对面的团队工作坊、辅导和头脑风暴，否则在办公室的时间就会花在“开 Zoom 会议”上。她表示，创造社交时刻有助于年轻人“融入公司”。与懒惰的刻板印象和鼓励“无声辞职”的网络迷因相反，办公集团 IWG 创始人兼首席执行官 Mark Dixon 表示，Z 世代“不仅正在迅速崛起成为具有巨大影响力的群体，而且工作非常努力”，并且“期望在职业生活和个人追求之间取得健康的平衡”。对驾驭白领工作场所的兴趣部分解释了办公室相关社交媒体内容激增的原因。风险顾问 Jemima Grace 是许多制作关于企业工作生活 TikTok 视频的 Z 世代员工之一。他们的视频内容包括办公室穿搭、准备参加社交活动以及“和我一起准备”早晨例行活动。Grace 最近发布了一个 #corporategirlies“一天生活”视频，记录了她早上 7:20 乘坐地铁，8:15 到达办公室，然后回复 Teams 消息，在办公桌前吃午饭，阅读提案并制作演示文稿，最后在下午 6 点离开。该视频播放量达到 400 万次，获得 18 万次点赞，远超她平时的内容。Grace 认为此类帖子有助于 Z 世代应对职场。“年轻人想，‘我到底该怎么办？’TikTok 上的人比较年轻，而且他们不知道（办公室日常）是什么样的。”然而，一些评论让她感到惊讶。有很多评论说，“感谢上帝我不用这样做。”其他人则说她看起来不开心。"

    "time": "2 hours ago",
    "content": "US capital in upheaval as government lay-offs pummel local economy and Maga allies embed in social scene Alex Butterworth is the primary investor in Butterworth’s, a restaurant in Washington that has become a central spot for Trump administration officials and allies © Greg Kahn/FT Ethan Landis, chief executive of an architecture and construction group, was ready to begin a $730,000 remodelling project on a townhouse in Washington when his client slashed the budget for the renovation to $200,000. Landis, co-founder of Landis Architects|Builders, said many of his clients had become hesitant to commit to such big projects — and he pins at least some of the blame on the Trump administration’s mission to sack thousands of federal workers and cut billions of dollars in government funding. “Maybe one in 10 [clients], it seems to be impacting their decision-making process. And not that they’re saying no, but they’re saying, ‘let’s put something off for six months or a little while to see what happens’,” added Landis, whose company takes on about 40 projects a year. President Donald Trump and top adviser Elon Musk’s drastic reshaping of the government is likely to wallop the region’s economy, according to economists and economic development experts. The angst is palpable throughout Washington’s restaurants, bars, house parties and even streets, where it is common to hear people talking about government lay-offs and Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), the administration’s cost-cutting effort. At the same time, the Maga faithful have descended on Washington, intent on remaking the city, putting a cloud of uncertainty over the greater metropolitan area — which includes parts of Maryland and Virginia. Ethan Landis, chief executive of Landis Architects|Builders, at one of the homes his crew is remodelling © Greg Kahn/FT (Image: Ethan Landis) Trump last month signed an executive order that established a task force on the city’s appearance and safety. Trump had said that he wanted to make Washington “absolutely flawlessly beautiful” and that the federal government should “take over the governance” of Washington and “run it really, really properly”. “I think that we should run it strong, front it with law and order,” he said, adding that he did not want world leaders to see the “graffiti” and “tents” when they visited. He has already made his mark on the city’s cultural scene with his war on “woke” ideology. He fired Biden-appointed board members of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, making himself the new chair and packing it with a who’s-who of the Maga circuit. He also ordered the Smithsonian to overhaul its approach to exhibitions, claiming its world-renowned museums have been part of a “widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history” after coming “under the influence of a divisive, race-centred ideology”. Trump’s presence was felt this year at a glitzy annual tradition on the DC social calendar — the White House Correspondents Dinner — which was noticeably subdued as the president has moved to sue and defund media outlets. Maga supporters staged rival events in which they lampooned journalists. Musk’s Doge team, meanwhile, is considering cost-cutting measures at the National Gallery of Art, one of the country’s most visited museums, which gets the bulk of its budget from the federal government but purportedly operates independently of the White House. Amid Trump’s anti-DEI crusade, the city has removed giant yellow letters spelling out “Black lives matter” on the street outside the White House at the direction of Washington mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat. She acknowledged that the move came after conversations with the White House. But she said there were “bigger fish to fry”, such as “making sure our residents and our economy survives.” The federal government drives the economy of the Washington metropolitan area, which is the seventh largest in the US. It employs hundreds of thousands directly and supports other organisations with grants, while companies of all sizes and industries rely on federal contracts for their revenues. Local businesses and restaurants are already starting to see a pullback in consumer spending. “There’s no question that DC is going to be disproportionately affected by what’s going on,” said Simon Johnson, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology living in Washington. “The real damage, I think, is being done by the uncertainty about policy. A lot of people are hesitating to make big spending decisions,” Johnson said. Mike Macklin, president of Cameo Kitchens, a kitchen remodelling company, has laid off staff in recent months and “anticipates doom and gloom for the next couple months”. Cameo does 50 to 60 kitchens a year in northern Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington. Macklin is particularly worried about possible future cuts. “Is Doge going to spread to other agencies where it’s not really affected them yet, namely defence and intelligence?” Those employees made up “a huge portion of our customers” ever since the company’s name was passed around in special operations circles, he said. Mike Macklin of Cameo Kitchens says he ‘anticipates doom and gloom for the next couple months’ © Greg Kahn/FT (Image: Mike Macklin, president of Cameo Kitchens) With the federal government accounting for about 40 per cent of the regional economy, the economic hit was going to be “bad to very bad”, said Terry Clower, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. His modelling predicts that for every lost federal job, an additional 0.4 jobs will be lost due to the reduction in household earnings, though it is not “unrealistic to expect that the real job loss will [exceed] two jobs total” per axed federal position, because of the knock-on effects. There were 743,100 civilian federal workers living throughout Washington, Maryland and Virginia at the end of 2023, according to an analysis of a Census Bureau survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The district itself expects federal employment in the city to drop to 150,000 from 190,000 through fiscal year 2029, with a “mild recession” pencilled in for fiscal year 2026. In other recent downturns, Washington’s interconnectedness with the federal government gave its economy unique resilience. During the 2008 financial crisis, the district fared better than other US cities with more diversified economies. And at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the region added jobs as the government hired more workers to assist public health efforts and crisis response. That unique economic identity is now likely to change. “We see the changes in the federal landscape as really existential to our region,” said Julie Coons, chief executive of the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. At least that’s the view from one side of the political spectrum. Alex Butterworth, an Australian lawyer for Uber, is excited for the capital’s Maga makeover to usher in new arrivals. Butterworth is the primary investor in Butterworth’s, a restaurant in Washington’s Capitol Hill neighbourhood that has become a central spot for Trump administration officials and allies. Behind the restaurant’s pink facade is an eclectic, vintage interior inspired by French cafés and British pubs. Butterworth said they wanted to evoke the types of restaurants and bars found in Melbourne. “There aren’t a lot of places in Washington DC where truly anyone is welcome,” said Butterworth, who identifies as non-binary — a group the administration has targeted in its war on “gender ideology”. “Sure, people will say everyone is welcome here on the door, but they don’t really mean it because if you’re wearing a Maga hat, they won’t let you in.” Butterworth says of most places in Washington, ‘Sure, people will say everyone is welcome here on the door, but they don’t really mean it because if you’re wearing a Maga hat, they won’t let you in’ © Greg Kahn/FT (Image: Alex Butterworth, the primary investor in Butterworth’s, a café restaurant in Washington’s Capitol Hill neighborhood) Butterworth’s opened just before election day 2024. It doesn’t officially have ties to the Trump administration, but another investor, Raheem Kassam, is a former editor at Breitbart, where Trump ally Steve Bannon was an executive director. The two are pictured in a photo together at the restaurant posted to Kassam’s Instagram, and Bannon regularly hosts events at the restaurant. Other diners have included Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, FBI director Kash Patel, musician and Musk’s former partner Grimes, and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Amazon — owned by Jeff Bezos, who has upset many Democrats by his handling of his newspaper The Washington Post — has also hosted an event there. While there are chips, Butterworth insists on no cheeseburgers. “The Maga crowd is a lot more diverse than the media make them out to be,” they said. “You have people who like foie gras martinis and bone marrow.” To cater to a group that Butterworth said has a more refined taste than people may expect, the menu includes duck, rabbit and venison. Administration officials such as Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick have also been spotted at Ned’s, a members’ club close to the White House with spectacular views that charges an initiation fee of $5,000 and $5,000 annually. Elsewhere in the city, the restaurant outlook is grim, with 44 per cent of Washington’s full-service casual dining spots saying they are likely to close this year, partly because of the economic effects of federal lay-offs, according to a survey from the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington. The city, which as a federal district is in many respects at the mercy of the Republican-controlled Congress, is waiting to see whether it faces a potential $1bn budget cut. Earlier this month Bowser ordered a spending and hiring freeze that could reduce critical services to account for the budget shortfall. She called them “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” actions, warning there could be city government furloughs. There are early signs the lay-offs and spending cuts might have begun to touch the region’s housing market as well, according to Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, the region’s multiple listing service, a database where estate agents share information about properties for sale. In the nine weeks to April 20, new listings in the greater Washington area outpaced the increase in the entire mid-Atlantic from a year ago, according to Bright MLS data.

    "content": "Viktor Orbán faces scrutiny over his tightening grip on critical voices Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has for years clashed with the EU over his goal to turn Hungary into an ‘illiberal’ state © Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images (Image: Viktor Orbán stands at a podium during a press conference) Viktor Orbán’s government is being accused of handing more than €1bn in unlawful subsidies to pro-government media, adding to concerns that state support is being used to bolster the Hungarian leader’s grip on power. Two Hungarian media outlets — Magyar Hang (Hungarian Voice) and a second that has requested anonymity — told the Financial Times they were aiming to lodge a complaint with the European Commission on Monday. They claim advertising revenue was channelled to pro-Orbán newspapers, television stations and online platforms between 2015 and 2023 to ensure support for the ruling party and to crowd out critical journalism. Orbán, the EU’s most pro-Russia leader, has for years clashed with the bloc over his goal to turn Hungary into an “illiberal” state. Brussels has repeatedly frozen and clawed back EU funds and the bloc’s courts have ruled against his moves to limit the independence of the judiciary, the media and the education system. The prime minister has used EU funds to reward political allies in the past. He has dubbed the partnership between the government and private sector as a “system of national co-operation”. The alleged use of state subsidies coincided with a campaign to rid the country’s media of outlets critical of the government, according to Kai-Uwe Kühn, a former European competition official who wrote an economic study accompanying the complaint. “You really see after someone takes over a newspaper and turns it into a government-aligned newspaper, advertising starts going up dramatically,” he said. Kühn said the data in his report points to a causal linkage between the alleged illegal state aid and the medium’s pro-government stance — which distorts competition on the Hungarian media market in favour of pro-Orbán outlets. During his time in power, Orbán has increasingly tightened his grip on Hungary’s media and squeezed out alternative viewpoints. Several independent titles have collapsed or been sold to government-linked figures in recent years. Press freedom watchdogs, such as Reporters Without Borders, have ranked Hungary among the lowest in the EU for media freedom. Independent outlets find it increasingly difficult to operate, with state subsidies further distorting the landscape, said Lukács Csaba, managing director of Magyar Hang. “We are getting smear campaigns, we are getting sued.” His complaint comes after other Hungarian outlets in 2019 raised the issue of illegal state aid with the commission to government-friendly groups in the form of public advertisements. A spokesperson for the commission said the assessment of that complaint was “ongoing”. “We’re trying to increase the pressure on the commission to move quickly,” said Oliver Bretz of Euclid Law, the law firm supporting the complainants. If this were another industry sector and not media, the commission “would not have sat on it as long as they have”, he said. “This is egregious state aid.” In parallel, the commission is also suing Hungary’s government over a security law because Brussels argues it violates EU rules on privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association. General elections next year are shaping up as a first significant test for Orbán, whose Fidesz party fell behind the opposition for the first time in opinion polls last year. Tisza, a new opposition group led by Péter Magyar — a former Fidesz member who grew disillusioned with the prime minister — has criticised Orbán’s strategy of expanding his control over the media, courts and the economy. Tisza made a strong showing in last year’s European parliament elections, positioning Magyar as the first serious challenger to Orbán’s decades-long rule. Hungary’s government did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the commission said they had “no specific comment” on this particular complaint.
