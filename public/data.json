    "title": "China’s data protection rules prompt pause from major European research funders",
    "time": "4 hours ago",
    "content": "A hand is seen on a laptop with binary codes displayed in front of the Chinese flag in this illustration taken, August 19, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\nSHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - Several of Europe’s biggest funders of scientific collaboration with China, in fields such as viruses and air quality, have put bilateral research programmes on hold due to concerns over Chinese data protection laws, funding agencies said. The suspension, which Reuters is reporting for the first time following queries to the agencies on funding, highlights the widening impact of a Chinese data protection law that has already impeded some business projects , as international institutions and companies assess how to navigate the regulations. While many countries require various protections and privacy safeguards for research involving their citizens, one of China’s most recent laws – known as the Data Security Law – makes it illegal to share any \"important data\" with overseas partners without approval. Three European funding agencies - the German Research Foundation, Swedish Research Council and Swiss National Science Foundation - told Reuters that they had not offered new co-funding for projects with the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) since 2021, the year the law took effect. They said they would not jointly fund new research projects with the NSFC due to concerns over access to data, potential conflict with local data law, or legal liabilities for themselves or research institutes for breaches of the law's vaguely-defined provisions. What constitutes \"important data\", a designation requiring security clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China to export, is of particular concern. \"It is not clear what the definition of 'important data' is,\" the Swiss National Science Foundation told Reuters. \"It is therefore difficult for the Swiss research community to assess when and under what circumstances a research collaboration could be subject to sanctions or even penalties.\" China had defined \"important data\" as data that poses a threat to national and economic interests or affects the rights of individuals or organisations, and has not provided further details. A dataset classified as \"important data\" means \"it will be extremely difficult (if not virtually impossible) to export these data from China to another country,\" the German Research Foundation told Reuters. The suspension could potentially delay research in the health sector - one area of joint collaboration funders had previously supported - at the same time as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump moves to freeze billions of dollars in U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, cut 1,200 of that agency's staff and withdraw from the World Health Organization . It could also influence other research institutes' perceptions about the Data Security Law and similar laws in China. \"The concerns about how the data laws are being applied exist, and are very real,\" said Jan Palmowski, secretary-general of the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities. \"We saw that responding to the COVID pandemic effectively required global sharing of data on a massive scale; but we have also seen national sensitivities around data relating to the origin of COVID,\" Palmowski added. \"If we want to be agile in responding to future pandemics and address other key health challenges, we need to find ways to share data responsibly, safely, and according to common ethical rules.\" In their last projects with the NSFC, the Swedish Research Council provided about 36 million Swedish crowns ($3.7 million) in funding, the Swiss National Science Foundation 4.8 million Swiss francs ($5.8 million) and German Research Foundation 6.6 million euros ($7.51 million), according to statistics the European funders provided. \"They (China's science ministry) don't understand why (the problem) needs to be clarified on a government to government level,\" said a European government official who is discussing the data security law with the ministry. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order not to jeopardise its discussions with the ministry. China's science ministry and the Cyberspace Administration of China did not reply to requests for comment. The three funders were among the top 50 overseas co-funding agencies with the NSFC, China's top funder on scientific publications, in documents registered to the Web of Science publication database between 2015 and 2024, data Clarivate provided to Reuters showed. They have previously accepted proposals for jointly-funded research projects in subjects including the airborne spread of antibiotic resistance , opens new tab and the virus that causes COVID-19 , opens new tab . Other countries have also expressed concerns including the U.S. which has previously said what China considers \"important data\" in the data security law is broad and vaguely defined , opens new tab . Kei Koizumi, a former White House science policy official, told Reuters that U.S. agencies including the NIH, National Science Foundation, and Department of Energy expressed concerns about data access and researcher protections and they were incorporated into a U.S.-China science deal announced in December . He did not elaborate further. According to the agreement, which Reuters obtained from the US State Department via a Freedom of Information request, the two countries agreed to carry out a complete and timely exchange of data from cooperation activities and meet about differences in data management and access plans within 60 days of a dispute mechanism being triggered. UK Research and Innovation also told Reuters it was “actively engaged in discussions with Chinese research funders” about China data laws. It said it would \"share guidance\" to its research grant applicants \"where necessary and appropriate\". Some observers are hopeful of change. \"In the present ongoing approach between the EU and China, due to the US situation, there is an opportunity for pushing China to relax its rules,\" Kurt Deketelaere, Secretary-General of the League of European Research Universities, told Reuters.

    "content": "Gold is displayed at a jewelry store in Tehran, Iran, March 26, 2025. Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS/File Photo\nApril 25 (Reuters) - Gold prices declined on Friday as China mulls suspending tariffs on certain U.S. imports, denting the metal's safe-haven appeal. Spot gold fell 0.8% to $3,322.36 an ounce as of 0421 GMT. U.S. gold futures shed 0.5% to $3,332.90. \"The partial rollback of tariffs on some imports from China may be perceived as a positive step towards further de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, which exert modest downward pressure on safe-haven assets like gold,\" said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. China may exempt some U.S. imports from its 125% tariffs and is asking businesses to identify goods that could be eligible in the biggest sign yet that Beijing is anxious about the trade war's economic fallout. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that trade talks with China are underway, pushing back against Chinese claims that no discussions have taken place to ease the ongoing trade war. A spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said that if the U.S. \"truely\" wants to resolve the dispute, it should lift all unilateral tariff measures against China. Non-yielding bullion, often viewed as a safeguard against global instability and which thrives in low interest rate environments, has surged over $700 this year, scaling multiple record peaks. It reached $3,500.05 on Tuesday. \"Over the longer term, structural tailwind remains intact, with further room for reserve diversification among emerging markets as they gradually align with the reserve composition of advanced economies,\" Rong said. Fed officials indicated they saw no urgency in revising the monetary policy as they sought more information to determine how the Trump administration's tariffs were affecting the economy. On the geopolitical front, Trump rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin after a Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the biggest this year, resulted in at least 12 deaths.

    "time": "42 min ago",
    "content": "U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this photo illustration taken February 12, 2018. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/Illustration/File Photo\nTOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped on Friday, reversing losses from the prior day after a media report that China was weighing tariff exemptions for some U.S. goods, stoking hopes for a de-escalation in a spiralling trade war between the world's two largest economies. The U.S. currency has been whipsawed this week by conflicting signs for a thaw in fraught relations between Washington and Beijing. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump mooted a de-escalation of their tit-for-tat tariff battle, and said direct talks were already underway. Beijing later denied that discussions had started. \"Traders are definitely headline-chasing at the moment,\" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street. \"If there's any sort of sign of an unwinding of these tariffs, there's going to be an unwinding of positions that have been put in place because of them.\" On Friday, Bloomberg News reported that China is considering suspending 125% levies on U.S. medical equipment and some industrial chemicals. The dollar climbed 0.7% to 143.665 yen as of 0435 GMT, and strengthened 0.6% to 0.8318 Swiss franc . The euro sank 0.5% to $1.1327. Sterling declined 0.4% to $1.3287. The U.S. dollar index , which measures the currency against those four rivals and two other major counterparts, gained 0.4% to 99.792. Trump had rocked the dollar at the start of the week, sending it spiralling lower against major peers with his threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. It then jumped back on Tuesday when the president said he never had any intention of replacing the central bank boss. Friday's rally puts the dollar index on course for a 0.6% advance, which would snap a four-week losing run that was driven by fears of a tariffs-induced U.S. recession, and on investors' loss of confidence in U.S. assets due to Trump's policy flip-flops. Washington has made some progress in early trade talks with Asian allies South Korea and Japan, however. Seoul's delegation said on Thursday following the first round of negotiations that the two sides are aiming to craft a trade package before the pause on reciprocal tariffs is lifted in July. The Japanese Finance Minister said the same day after meeting U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that there were no talks on currency targets. Trump had accused Tokyo earlier this month of weakening its currency to give its exporters an edge. Japan's chief negotiator, economy minister Ryosei Akazawa, will hold a second round of trade talks with Bessent next week. \"If the perception spreads that a reduction in tariffs is near, it could positively influence tariff negotiations with other countries, leading to a retreat from risk-off sentiment and a decrease in U.S. asset selling,\" which could buoy the dollar back to 145 yen, Mizuho analysts wrote in a note. \"On the other hand, if negotiations look difficult even with Japan, a key ally, one can only imagine the situation with China.\" Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda on Thursday reiterated the central bank's commitment to raising interest rates if underlying inflation evolves toward the 2% target as projected, but repeated that policymakers need to scrutinize the fallout from U.S. tariffs. Core consumer prices in Japan's capital rose 3.4% in April from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, accelerating for the second straight month. The BOJ is widely expected to leave policy settings unchanged at its two-day meeting ending May 1. Bitcoin was steady at around $93,200, as it continues to hover just below Wednesday's high of $94,489.92, the strongest level since March 3.\nThe Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo\nApril 25 (Reuters) - China is considering exempting some U.S. imports from its 125% tariffs and is asking businesses to identify goods that could be eligible in the biggest sign yet that Beijing is worried about the economic fallout from its trade war with Washington. A Ministry of Commerce taskforce is collecting lists of items that could be exempted from tariffs and is asking companies to submit their own requests, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Financial news magazine Caijing reported on Friday citing sources that Beijing was preparing to include eight semiconductor-related items, although not memory chips. \"The Chinese government, for example, has been asking our companies what sort of things are you importing to China from the U.S. that you cannot find anywhere else and so would shut down your supply chain,\" American Chamber of Commerce in China President Michael Hart said on Friday. Some chamber members say they have imported goods in the past week without the new tariffs being applied, Hart added. A list of 131 categories of products eligible for exemptions was circulating widely on social media and among businesses and trade groups on Friday. Reuters could not verify the list, whose items ranged from vaccines and chemicals to jet engines. While Beijing's ultimate course of action remains unknown, Huatai Securities analysed the list circulating in trade groups and said it corresponded to $45 billion worth of imports last year. Repeated phone calls to China's customs department were not answered. Customs and the Ministry of Commerce did not reply to faxed questions. While Washington has said the current status quo is economically untenable and already offered tariff exemptions to some electronic goods, China has repeatedly said it is willing to fight to the end unless the U.S. lifts its tariffs. But beneath the bombast, China's economy is entering the trade war flirting with deflation. Demand is weak and consumer spending and sentiment have never properly recovered from the pandemic levels. The government is pushing tariff-hit exporters to pivot to local markets, but companies say profits are lower, demand weaker and customers less reliable . Exemptions are a bigger gesture of support, although by allowing some trade to resume, they also reduce the pain for the U.S. economy and take some pressure off the White House. Many imports, ranging from petrochemical ethane to pharmaceuticals have few easy alternatives or could take years to manufacture outside the United States. Big pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and GSK (GSK.L) have at least one manufacturing site in the U.S. for drugs sold in China, according to Chinese government data. Major ethane processors have already sought tariff waivers from Beijing because the U.S. is the only supplier.\nThe Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news.
