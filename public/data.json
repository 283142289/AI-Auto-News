    "content": "Shipping containers at the Port of Los Angeles. Freight railroad group Norfolk Southern says tariffs could slow down shipments of cars and intermodal containers © Frederic Brown/AFP/Getty Images Corporate America is counting the cost of Donald Trump’s trade war, with executives warning of escalating expenditures, gummed-up supply chains and a hit to the world’s largest economy.While company leaders have generally avoided public criticism of the US president, they have been forced to confront his tariffs — which include levies of 145 per cent against export powerhouse China — on quarterly earnings calls with analysts this month.Transport, energy, telecommunications and homebuilding companies were among those to discuss the tariffs with Wall Street. In their comments, executives raised the alarm about the consequences of Trump’s sweeping duties, echoing economists’ warnings of recession.“CEOs are a really unhappy bunch at the moment,” said Steven Purdy, head of credit research at fund manager TCW.Trump was warned of the impact his tariffs were having on trade by the chief executives of Walmart and Target in a meeting at the White House on Monday, according to one person familiar with the situation.While fewer than a fifth of the blue-chip stocks in the S&P 500 index had held first-quarter earnings calls by Tuesday, tariffs were cited on more than 90 per cent of them, according to FactSet. The term “recession” was mentioned on 44 per cent of calls, compared with less than 3 per cent on those covering the fourth quarter of 2024.Norfolk Southern, a big US freight railroad group, on Wednesday said that tariffs could slow down shipments of cars and intermodal containers, while coal production might cool “amid significant uncertainty around export trade”. Boeing also said on Wednesday that the US trade war with China would force it to find alternative buyers for some of its aircraft.Tariffs will drive up the cost of gas-fired power generators, just as US electricity demand grows at a rate “unlike anything we’ve ever seen since the end of World War II”, John Ketchum, chief executive of NextEra Energy, owner of the largest US power utility, said on Wednesday.Gas turbine manufacturer GE Vernova said its costs could rise as much as $400mn this year, while oilfield services groups Halliburton and Baker Hughes warned that Trump’s trade war could dent earnings, disrupt supply chains and push down oil prices, causing a pullback in drilling.Baker Hughes’ shares fell by 6.4 per cent on Wednesday after it said tariffs could cost the company up to $200mn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year.AT&T and Verizon, two of the biggest US telecoms groups, warned that tariffs could raise the price of phone handsets and wireless routers.“If the tariff is going to be as high as they say on the handsets, we are not planning to cover that in our work. That’s just not going to be possible,” Verizon chief executive Hans Vestberg told analysts this week.Boston Scientific said tariffs would cost the medical-device maker about $200mn this year, even as it raised its profit guidance. Johnson & Johnson last week maintained its annual earnings forecast but noted $400mn in costs related mainly to tariffs on medical devices.At 3M, chief executive William Brown said “tariffs are going to be a headwind this year”. The manufacturer of Scotch tape and Post-it notes said it would try to soften the blow by moving production and inventory around its network of 110 factories and 88 distribution centres, by cutting costs and by raising prices.“We’re trying to be pretty smart, strategic and surgical about this,” Brown said.At builder PulteGroup, chief executive Ryan Marshall said tariffs would add about $5,000 on average to the sale price of new homes.“Whether it’s the volatility in the stock market, concerns about tariff-induced inflation, the fluctuation in interest rates or the growing talk of recession, demand in April has been more volatile and less predictable day-to-day,” Marshall told analysts.Aerospace and defence company RTX said it could suffer an $850mn hit to pre-tax operating profit from Trump’s tariffs if they remained in place to the end of the year. GE Aerospace said it would raise prices to help offset roughly $500mn in extra costs.Executives have been responding to fast-changing US trade policy. Trump in early April suspended so-called reciprocal tariffs against most countries for 90 days hours after they took effect, while raising tariffs on China.He plans to spare carmakers from some tariffs, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.TCW’s Purdy said CEOs were stuck in a kind of suspended animation as trade policy changes.“They don’t know if they’re going to wake up in six months into an entirely new world order, or if this is going to feel like a really bad dream,” Purdy said.Reporting by Gregory Meyer, George Steer, Jamie Smyth, Peter Wells, Zehra Munir, Will Schmitt and Demetri Sevastopulo"

    "content": "A ballistic missile explodes in the sky over Kyiv during a Russian strike © REUTERS Russian air strikes targeting Kyiv overnight killed at least nine people and injured more than 70 others, in the deadliest and largest bombardment of the Ukrainian capital in months, authorities have said.Ukraine’s state emergency service said 42 people were hospitalised, including six children, after ballistic missiles and drones struck apartment buildings in Kyiv, home to nearly 4mn residents.Strikes also hit several other cities across seven regions in the country.Ukrainian foreign minister Andriy Sybiha said on Thursday morning that the Russian attack, along with Moscow’s maximalist demands for Ukraine to withdraw forces from its own regions, “show that Russia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace”.“Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied,” Sybiha said in a post on X.Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city military administration, wrote on his Telegram channel on Thursday that the Russian missiles and drones had caused massive destruction and sparked fires in several residential buildings.The attacks came a day after President Donald Trump admonished Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to make concessions to secure peace and go along with a proposal for the US to recognise Russia’s occupation of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014.“He can have Peace, or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,” Trump said of Zelenskyy in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday. “We are very close to a Deal, but the man with ‘no cards to play’ should now, finally, GET IT DONE,” he added, describing the situation for Ukraine as “dire”.Later on Wednesday Trump again aired his frustration with Zelenskyy, telling reporters in the Oval Office in Washington that he “thought it might be easier to deal” with him than with Russian President Vladimir Putin but “so far, it’s been harder”.Russia’s attack began after midnight in Kyiv while Trump was speaking.Trump’s comments came shortly after vice-president JD Vance cautioned that the White House might abandon its own peace negotiations if talks with Kyiv and Moscow failed to move forward.Zelenskyy said afterwards in a statement that emotions had “run high” on Wednesday, but he was hopeful that work with the US and other partners “will lead to lasting peace”.He added that Ukraine would “always act in accordance with its Constitution”, a reference to Crimea’s place as part of Ukraine being enshrined in the country’s laws.Zelenskyy included in his statement a screen grab of the Trump administration’s 2018 “Crimea declaration”, made by then secretary of state Mike Pompeo, calling the Black Sea peninsula a “territory seized by force in contravention of international law”.The declaration included the clause: “The United States rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain this policy until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored.”"

    "title": "Former EY and PwC bosses launch UK boutique targeting Big Four clients",
    "time": "4 hours ago",
    "content": "Steve Varley ran EY for nine years: ‘People are looking for a proposition that is super client-centric [and] has really low administrative cost’ © Warburg Pincus The former UK head of EY and PwC’s former chief operating officer are launching a rival accounting and consulting firm with backing from private equity, vowing to peel off British clients and partners from the Big Four.The new venture, Unity Advisory, has quietly begun recruiting for a launch expected by June, under the chairmanship of Steve Varley, who ran EY for nine years until 2020. The boutique advisory firm will be backed by as much as $300mn from Warburg Pincus, the private equity group.Unity’s chief executive will be Marissa Thomas, who was one of the most senior female UK executives at PwC until last year, when she was passed over for the role of senior partner. She left the firm in February.The pair are pitching their new venture as an alternative to the Big Four that can offer tax and accounting services, technology consulting and mergers and acquisition advice to chief financial officers in the UK, with none of the conflict of interest worries that plague their former firms. Unity will not have an audit business, which Big Four partners often complain triggers heavy regulatory scrutiny and can tie them up with complicated compliance procedures.“CFOs are open to a new proposition,” Varley told the Financial Times. “The Big Four are a classy bunch of service providers, but people are looking for a proposition that is super client-centric, has really low administrative cost, is AI-led rather than based on legacy infrastructure and, crucially, has no conflicts.”Warburg Pincus’s backing of up to $300mn to build out the firm underscores the growing influence of financial investors in a professional services sector that used to be dominated by partner-owned business models.Grant Thornton UK last year sold a majority stake to the private equity group Cinven, following a wave of similar deals for accounting firms overseas. In 2019, Warburg Pincus backed veteran insurance broker Steve McGill in creating an independent speciality risk insurance business.“Partnerships have a lot of advantages,” Varley said, “but one of the things they don’t do well is medium to long-term investment.”Varley left EY at the end of 2023 and is chair of the law firm DWF Group, which also has private equity backing. Thomas spent 31 years at PwC, running its UK M&A advisory business and its tax unit before becoming chief operating officer. She was widely tipped internally as a contender for the senior partner role that went last year to Marco Amitrano but failed to reach the shortlist of candidates put to a partner vote.Thomas said Unity would be hiring staff with Big Four experience, including those who have left those firms for jobs in industry, and targeting mid-size corporate clients with revenues in the £500mn-£1.5bn range, particularly those backed by private equity.The new firm’s lower central cost base and the absence of audit clients would allow “different fee models”, such as a larger proportion of performance-based fees or “value sharing” from advising on efficiency gains, she said.David Reis, Warburg Pincus managing director, said Unity would be “a new kind of platform that challenges the status quo in how CFOs and finance teams are serviced”, and that there was “substantial market opportunity for disruption”."

    "title": "Rebecca Kelly Slaughter & Alvaro Bedoya: Trump’s move to fire us is a terrible warning for the US economy",
    "time": "4 hours ago",
    "content": "If the FTC and other once-independent agencies become political weapons for Democratic and Republican presidents to come, there is no going back © REUTERS The writers are former US Federal Trade Commissioners challenging their removalIf you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you’re sceptical of regulators. But you should hope we win our recently-filed lawsuit to restore our positions at the US Federal Trade Commission after President Donald Trump informed us in March that he was firing us.As commissioners of the FTC, we aggressively enforced antitrust laws, cracked down on unfair business practices and opposed corporate concentration of economic power at the expense of consumers, workers and small businesses.It’s no secret that business and finance leaders have criticised our approach. But love us or loathe us, our dismissal is a terrifying warning sign for the future of the American economy.The success of the American economy is powered by entrepreneurs who grow successful businesses. For 90 years businesses have known that the federal government will be both transparent and independent in applying the market regulation laws passed by Congress. The consistent application of the rule of law helps businesses invest for the long term.We were both confirmed by the Senate for terms that have not concluded. One of us was originally nominated by President Trump himself and confirmed unanimously twice. Our lawsuit — which asks only that we be allowed to carry out those terms — is not about our own economic philosophies. It’s not about liberals versus conservatives or laissez-faire versus regulation. It’s about whether the US is ruled by laws or political whims.In the 1935 case Humphrey’s Executor vs United States, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that the president cannot remove FTC commissioners without cause. For nearly a century, that same principle has protected the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators from political pressure. That insulation from politics matters if we want regulators to make decisions that are good for the American economy rather than politicians.Today, the FTC is suing Amazon and Meta and enforcing a consent decree against X — all companies with personal, political and financial relationships with President Trump. Without removal protections, he could simply fire FTC members until he finds a group that will drop those actions. You might disagree with those lawsuits, but if these once-independent agencies become political weapons for Democratic and Republican presidents to come, there is no going back.When any president can manipulate the FTC, the Fed, the SEC and the rest of our nation’s economic regulators for political gain, predictability is undermined. As we have seen with the recent imposition of tariffs, when uncertainty saps confidence, market instability follows.Among other dangers, stripping these agencies of their independence drives investors in Treasury bonds away and even threatens to upend an agreement that allows European Economic Area residents and businesses to transfer data to the US, needlessly risking a multibillion-dollar engine of digital trade.A group of leading scholars of financial regulation and central banking have urged the Supreme Court to preserve the independence of the Fed, in particular. And they state in unequivocal terms that “overturning or more narrowly construing Humphrey’s Executor would threaten Fed independence”. That should terrify Americans across the political and economic spectrum.Whether it’s the Fed, the FDIC, the FTC or others, the ability of regulators to carry out our work without fear or favour is a bedrock principle that protects us all. It’s what prevents businesses from being ripped off by politicians and politicians from ripping apart our economy. That’s a principle worth preserving."

    "title": "Should corporate whistleblowers get paid?",
    "time": "4 hours ago",
    "content": "Despite numerous examples of the risks that whistleblowers take, UK regulators have long been resistant to offer financial incentives © FT montage/AP When Daniel Sheard blew the whistle on a scandal that rocked the Swiss fund manager GAM, he was prepared for it to be a tough experience.In 2017, Sheard began warning the company that he was worried about investments being overseen by his boss, the star fund manager Tim Haywood, into bonds created and sold by Australian financier Lex Greensill’s company. When Sheard felt that his concerns were not being taken seriously enough, he took them to the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, the following year.“Your life goes on hold,” he remembers. “For two years, it was the first thing I thought about in the morning and the last thing I thought about at night. It was also challenging for the people around me, who didn’t understand what was going on.”In 2021, the FCA fined GAM £9.1mn for failing to manage conflicts of interest and Haywood £230,037 personally. But Sheard, for all that he would eventually be proved right, was not treated like a hero — far from it.GAM laid him off, along with many of his colleagues, in the crisis that followed the revelations. Feeling that he was a pariah, he then struggled to find another job, eventually spending several years out of work. And he was left with legal bills of more than £36,000.“Whistleblowing has been a disaster,” he says. “[And] many whistleblowers are in a far worse position than I am.”Daniel Sheard, who spoke out about the Swiss fund manager GAM, looks back with distress at the experience. ‘Your life goes on hold,’ he recalls © Dominic Lipinski/FT Corporate whistleblowers in the UK sometimes find themselves in an invidious position. On the one hand, they are actively encouraged to go to the authorities if they see evidence of wrongdoing; the FCA urges reports to be made in confidence, as do agencies including the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).On the other, anyone who blows the whistle in the UK takes on considerable risk — ranging from the fear of losing their job and being blacklisted to the stress of hiring lawyers and going up against corporate giants with deep pockets.Despite numerous examples of the financial and emotional damage that can occur, regulators have long been resistant to offering whistleblowers financial rewards.This is in stark contrast to jurisdictions such as the US, where for more than a decade it has been standard practice to offer whistleblowers money if a case is brought successfully. These amounts can run to many millions of dollars. Other countries, including Canada, South Korea, and Nigeria also offer whistleblowers financial incentives.Such schemes can be effective, according to a report published by the Royal United Services Institute think-tank in December. Its research found that whistleblowers in places such as the US were encouraged to speak out not just because of money, but because they felt better protected by designated and properly managed whistleblower schemes. An effective programme could help reduce white-collar offences, it concluded.The SFO recently submitted a paper to the UK government outlining how a scheme could work, and on Thursday announced that it intends to offer more deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) to companies that report the discovery of wrongdoing promptly and co-operate with an investigation. It hopes the two actions could lead to more success in cracking down on corporate crime.In parliament, a private members’ bill calling for an independent Office of the Whistleblower to be set up is currently being scrutinised. And this week, the Home Office announced that, as part of a review of UK fraud offences, the barrister Jonathan Fisher KC will look at incentives for whistleblowers.Adding pressure is the changing political environment in the US, especially when it comes to sanctions for corporate crime. In February, Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), impacting laws the US has used to hold some of the world’s biggest companies to account.“The UK right now has a chance to leapfrog the US,” says Mary Inman, a US lawyer who specialises in whistleblower cases. “There are going to be a lot of very unhappy whistleblowers in the US looking for other jurisdictions.”The long-standing British reluctance to offer whistleblowers financial incentives is partly institutional. Many in government and law enforcement make a moral case: whistleblowers have a responsibility to do the right thing, and that should be enough.But there are practical concerns too. One is that this might create a mercenary culture similar to the US, where a large proportion of litigation ends in settlement and law firms have built an industry that relies on such work. Another is that, just as juries are often suspicious of informants, they might be less likely to trust the word of someone seen to be incentivised by money.“The UK has historically been culturally resistant to rewarding whistleblowers,” says Judith Seddon, a lawyer at the UK firm Ashurst, arguing that authorities have been “dismissive of calls that doing so would increase the number and quality of disclosures”.Mary Inman, a US lawyer who specialises in whistleblower cases, at her home in San Francisco. ‘The UK right now has a chance to leapfrog the US,’ she says © Winni Wintermeyer/FT In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis and the Libor scandal, the government asked financial regulators to look at whether Britain should start paying whistleblowers. In 2014, after a review, the watchdogs rejected the idea. In an interview with Bloomberg four years later, the then-director of the SFO, David Green, summed up the view of many when he said that it “just isn’t British”.But critics say that the results of this approach tell their own story. Since 2012, more than 700 UK-based whistleblowers, taking advantage of the fact that the issues they want to report on have links to the US, have taken their concerns to American enforcement agencies, according to Green’s successor, Nick Ephgrave.If something similar were happening in counterterrorism or organised crime, there would be action, Ephgrave argues. “If we had this kind of leakage going to other jurisdictions [in those areas], there’d be an outcry,” he says.Since taking over at the SFO in 2023, Ephgrave has been pushing for the UK to change its ways. A former police officer, he points out that the police regularly pay informants of violent crime. Between 2015 and 2023, London’s Metropolitan Police paid out £7.5mn to informants. And he is sceptical of the argument that juries might react badly — not least, he says, because it is unlikely that a whistleblower would end up in front of one.Ephgrave says he thinks of whistleblowers as “key holders”. “They are the people inside an organisation that know where the skeletons are [for us to find].”The UK does have some limited payment schemes for economic crime. The CMA and HM Revenue & Customs both offer payments for information on cartels and tax fraud respectively. But the programmes are little publicised and the rewards are comparatively small, especially if a whistleblower risks being exiled from an industry where they have worked for their entire career. The CMA now pays out a maximum of £250,000 for information, while the total amount that HMRC paid out to whistleblowers in the 2023-24 tax year was less than £1mn.By comparison, since 2011 the US Securities and Exchange Commission has offered substantial rewards to whistleblowers whose information leads to a sanction. Under the programme, which pays a rate of between 10 and 30 per cent of penalties above $1mn, it has handed out more than $2bn. The agency’s largest ever reward stands at $279mn.The UK is already shifting its position on tax. In March HMRC announced plans to overhaul the compensation scheme for reports of serious tax fraud, taking inspiration from models in the US and Canada.Even the FCA — which has always been concerned that offering financial incentives would conflict with its regulatory duties — appears more open to the idea. Nikhil Rathi, the regulator’s chief executive, told the FT last year he was “not in principle opposed”, even though he believed it would be “highly countercultural” for the UK to go as far as the US.Another person who can speak from experience about why British authorities might want to start paying whistleblowers is George Patellis.Patellis had worked in the finance industry for the best part of 25 years when he discovered in 2011 that some directors of the loan company he headed, Tiuta, were misappropriating client funds.Within days, Patellis had gone to the FCA. He provided a map of the fraud he had uncovered and evidence of admissions of certain directors who had participated. But the FCA never took action, allowing investor losses to balloon to more than £100mn, according to Patellis.Now aged 60, he has not worked in finance at the same level since. “Everything that I worked hard for . . . I wanted to be able to help my kids buy a house . . . I wanted to give my daughter the wedding of her dreams. I couldn’t,” he says.He adds: “If you’re going to blow the whistle it’s going to be traumatic, but it’ll sure as shit soften the blow if you’ve been compensated for what you’ve gone through, right?”After filing a complaint over his treatment, Patellis received a public apology from the FCA — something he says was “a joke” because it did not mention either his name or that of the company in question. Eventually the FCA was forced to issue a fresh apology nine years after the events took place.FCA chair Ashley Alder faced calls to resign last year for failing to follow the watchdog’s rules on whistleblowing. He was eventually cleared © Anna Gordon/FT The FCA’s record on whistleblowers has not improved greatly since. The agency’s chair, Ashley Alder, came under fire last year for failing to follow the watchdog’s own rules on whistleblowing. While Alder was ultimately cleared of wrongdoing by an independent review, he was found to have broken the FCA’s policies.The FCA insists that “we rely on whistleblowing: it is a crucial source of intelligence in identifying and disrupting harm”, adding that “we are continuously developing and improving our approach”.The watchdog adds that it regularly receives more than 1,000 reports of alleged wrongdoing per year, and takes action on over half.Some whistleblowers based in Europe say that, while they too feel uncomfortable about the size of US-style rewards, most agree that a level of compensation should be provided.Nicolas Forissier, who blew the whistle on a vast tax evasion scheme for wealthy French clients at UBS, for which the bank was convicted in 2019, says that whistleblowers should be offered compensation for costs and any losses they have suffered “once they have been fully vindicated”.After more than 15 years of legal battles, in March Forissier won a partial victory against UBS, which was found guilty by a Paris court of harassing him and another whistleblower. But it came at a heavy price, he says, not least in terms of lawyers’ fees: “I had to sell my home to cover the costs.” UBS declined to comment.“It’s a huge amount to put on the line,” says Ephgrave of the SFO. “Twenty years, 30 years of work, your family’s welfare, your children, your partner, your lifestyle, your pension . . . You’ve got to live in the real world.”Advocates of change in the UK say that the US is just one of many models for a scheme. In 2024, South Korea paid out 5.2bn won (£2.8mn) for information across 392 cases under its whistleblower programmes, according to the country’s Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission.Not all awards in South Korea are conditional on a penalty being issued against an offending company; some are paid out if the report leads to an increase in government revenues. In an attempt to encourage more people to come forward, last year the country removed its 3bn won ceiling on the amount of money that can be awarded.In Nigeria, whistleblowers can receive between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent of the value of stolen or concealed public funds or assets, for information that leads to their return.The model proposed by Britain’s SFO is a scheme it calls “payment by results”, similar to the US — one where rewards are only paid out after a conviction or once a sanction has been given.Any scheme would be run by a new Office of the Whistleblower, either set up internally at the agency or as a centralised body. The private members’ bill calls for a government-run organization, while also proposing penalties against organizations and individuals for mistreatment of whistleblowers. But it does not call for financial rewards to be made available.Some specialists see the UK and its financial centres as ready for change in terms of protecting and supporting whistleblowers. ‘There’s a bit of a perfect storm starting — in a good way,’ says one © Pcruciatti/Dreamstime “The reward system is only one of the reasons that [the US] attracts UK whistleblowers,” says Georgina Halford-Hall, CEO of the lobby group Whistleblowers UK, which is backing the bill. “But there are other things. [The US] protect whistleblowers against backlash. They [have] lots of attorneys that are providing conditional fee agreements . . . They’re really, really experienced in it. We don’t have that in the UK because there’s been no money in it.”One person who believes that change in the UK is long overdue is Inman, the US lawyer, who has represented some of the world’s most high-profile whistleblowers: Tyler Shultz, who raised the alarm over the Theranos scandal; Frances Haugen, who blew the whistle on Facebook; and Mark MacGann, who exposed bad practices at Uber.Inman is now planning to move back to the UK. On a scouting mission in March, she sat down with Ephgrave and other stakeholders, and says there was a marked shift from the last time she lived in Britain from 2017 to 2020. “I feel like there’s a bit of a perfect storm starting — in a good way,” she says.Even former SFO director Green’s view is evolving. “Contexts change,” he says. “Given the current pause in FCPA enforcement in the US . . . the idea of rewarding whistleblowers may have found its time here.”“I think that if bodies such as the FCA are actively encouraging people to put themselves in harm’s way, they must have some kind of responsibility for minimising such harm,” says Sheard, who blew the whistle on GAM.He adds: “If you are going to do the right thing, should you bear the cost? Most people would agree that you shouldn’t.”Additional reporting by Emma Agyemang in Copenhagen"

    "content": "A worker at a garment factory in Guangzhou. Exporters across the country have been hit by US tariffs © Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Owners say American customers have cancelled or suspended orders Factories in China have begun slowing production and furloughing some workers as the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump dries up orders for products ranging from jeans to home appliances.With most Chinese goods now facing US duties of at least 145 per cent, some factory owners say American customers have cancelled or suspended orders, forcing them to cut production.About 15 per cent of all Chinese exports last year went to the US. In interviews with the Financial Times and dozens of social media posts, workers shared pictures of quiet production lines or factory suspension notices, highlighting how the tariffs are starting to bite.Workers said the trade war had prompted the suspension of production for a week or more at plants making products ranging from shoe soles to jeans, electrical outlets and portable stoves. Some factory owners said they were cutting overtime or weekend work.Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, an industry group representing more than 2,000 Chinese merchants, said many of them were “extremely anxious” and had told factories and suppliers to halt or delay deliveries. This had prompted some factories to suspend production for one to two weeks, she said.Three factory recruiters in Guangdong who work with manufacturers said more factories were cutting overtime and weekend work with only the most heavily dependent on American orders putting the whole factory on leave.“Our export orders disappeared so we’ve temporarily stopped,” said a 28-year-old plastics factory worker in Fujian province, who asked not to be identified. Production had been halted for a week so far, she said.Workers have posted videos on short video platform Douyin of factories going quiet Executives at DeHong Electrical Products in Dongguan, Guangdong province, gave workers one month leave on minimum wage and said the factory was under “significant near term pressure” after clients suspended orders.“Management is working hard to find solutions, including expanding into new markets and optimising cost structures, so we can resume normal operations as soon as possible,” DeHong said in a notice seen by the Financial Times. The company declined to comment further.Hangzhou Stellarmed, a company in Zhejiang province that makes endoscopy kits primarily for the US market, told full-time workers they could use the rest of April to find new jobs and provided them with access to a headhunting agency.“We don’t know how long this will last,” said Shi, the factory owner, who did not want to be identified by her full name. “We can only wait and see, there is nothing we can do.”Plastic mould maker Dongguan Yuanguan Technology blamed the tariffs for forcing it to cancel all weekend overtime at its factory, according to a company notice and a worker. Yuanguan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A 26-year-old man in Zhejiang said the toy factory he worked at sold mostly to the US, forcing management to give workers about two weeks off. “It’s not easy at the moment,” he said, asking not to be named.It is unclear how widespread the factory suspensions are, said Han Dongfang, founder of China Labour Bulletin, which closely tracks Chinese manufacturing and labour. “The rearrangement of China’s manufacturing sector will be a long-term process and workers will be sacrificed,” he said.China’s electronics supply chain also employs tens of thousands of people, and Washington has exempted smartphones along with some other electronics from the steepest tariffs.Big tech companies and cities with large concentrations of exporters, such as Shenzhen and Dongguan, are rolling out support programmes intended to “stabilise foreign trade”. Shenzhen last week unveiled subsidies for companies to participate in foreign trade shows and said it would expand export insurance to help cover cancelled US orders, among other policies.A manager at Ningbo Taiyun Electric said they had suspended production on April 12, but had since restarted reduced output of electric hair straighteners and curling irons. “We still have some orders from Europe, we’re trying to get more,” said the manager, who asked not to be named. “Hopefully the US will change its policies.” The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China, which reported a record trade surplus of nearly $1tn last year, has responded to Washington’s tariffs by imposing an extra 125 per cent levy on imports from the US. While Trump has repeatedly said he wants to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to resolve trade issues, Beijing appears in no hurry to request a call between the two leaders."

Shareholders are expected to back the proposal at the company’s May 7 annual meeting. She was paid $15.3mn in 2024, ISS data shows.Shareholders have already approved a pay increase for British American Tobacco chief executive Tadeu Marroco. He could receive up to $24.1mn if the company boosts its profitability and if its share price rises 50 per cent over three years. He was paid $14.1mn in 2024, according to ISS.The changes underscore a shift to offer larger pay packages for better performance and signal a change in mood among shareholders to support more competitive remuneration for UK-based chief executives.The UK’s Investment Association, a trade group, last year relaxed its stance on executive pay, giving companies more freedom to tailor pay to their own circumstances. In return, investors want disclosure on how companies benchmark their leaders’ pay against peers at other groups.In the US, companies stock and options awards typically comprise 70 per cent of pay, ISS said. Although CEO bonuses typically include financial performance metrics, some companies award pay even when the share price is down. CEO pay increased this year at 50 S&P 500 groups where total shareholder return declined last year, ISS said.The share price of Moderna, maker of a Covid-19 vaccine, has sunk to its lowest level since March 2020 as memories of the pandemic fade. Still, the company awarded one-time equity bonuses to chief financial officer James Mock and chief legal officer Shannon Thyme Klinger totalling $12mn each.These special awards were paid “to retain and motivate these key leaders, particularly in light of the decline in our stock price”, Moderna said in regulatory filings. Chief executive Stéphane Bancel’s pay also increased to $19.9mn from $17mn.Proxy adviser Glass Lewis has recommended shareholders vote against Moderna’s pay plan at the company’s April 30 annual meeting.Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.Amid increasing political tensions in the US this year, investors are unlikely “to rebel too much against [CEO] pay”, said George Georgiev, a professor at Emory University’s law school. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs shareholders approved $80mn bonuses to two executives, despite support falling to a nine-year low.“The asset managers are in go-along and get-along mode,” Georgiev said."

    "title": "The Elliott Management maverick waging war on Big Oil",
    "time": "4 hours ago",
    "content": "Under John Pike, Elliott has taken a series of high-profile energy positions in recent months © FT montage Other activist investors now take a less confrontational approach. John Pike is in a full-blown proxy fight John Pike had his target in his sights. The Elliott Management partner was facing off against the chief executive of Phillips 66, the oil and gas giant in which he had built a $2.5bn stake, across a Manhattan meeting room.Over the course of an hour, the Texan company and its legion of defence advisers had a final chance to negotiate a truce with the world’s most feared activist hedge fund and avert the type of expensive proxy fight for which Pike was becoming known. They failed.Within 24 hours Elliott had launched one of the most aggressive activist campaigns the energy sector had seen in years with a full-blown proxy battle for four seats on Phillips 66’s board, nominating a slate of new directors.The fight underlines how even as rivals have switched to behind-the- scenes lobbying and Elliott itself has softened its style, Pike embodies the hedge fund’s “old aggressive style”, according to former colleagues.The firm’s campaigns had become increasingly “corporatised and mature”, said another person who has come up against Elliott several times. But even though it emphasised its collegial nature, Pike’s approach stood out, they said, calling him “a lone wolf inside of Elliott who wants to do things a different way”.Under Pike, Elliott has taken a series of high-profile energy positions in recent months, seeking to guide the direction of blue-chip companies from BP in the UK to RWE in Germany — as well as at Phillips 66 in the US.“If you look at the most interesting campaigns Elliott is running right now, they are all his,” said another person who has dealt with Pike in a number of situations.To those who have worked with him, Pike is considered one of Elliott’s shrewdest investors.A 22-year Elliott veteran, Pike oversees “global situational teams” with specific expertise in energy — as well as utilities, transportation, mining and insurance — and became an equity partner in 2022. Last year, he ascended to its powerful 12-person management committee.A college basketball player who grew up in southern California and later graduated from Yale Law School, Pike’s demeanour is calm and deliberate. He keeps a low profile: the only image of him online is from his nomination to the Phillips 66 board.“It’s not hard to change John’s mind, you just have to be right,” said Quentin Koffey, who worked with Pike for seven years before leaving Elliott and later setting up his own activist fund, Politan Capital Management. “He responds to well-reasoned analysis, and is neither provoked nor swayed by shallow campaign rhetoric or ad hominem attacks.”His investment record points to a more ruthless style.Since Pike first picked a fight with US oil and gas group Hess in 2013, Elliott has invested at least $21.6bn in publicly traded energy companies, according to analysis by the Financial Times and data provider Def 14 Inc.Three of the four campaigns targeting major US corporations in which Elliott has gone so far as to mail proxy materials to shareholders have been led by Pike. Since his battle with Hess, Pike has won 13 board seats across five companies in the energy sector alone.Elliott’s energy campaigns are linked by a common thread: the break-up of large energy conglomerates to refocus them on their core competencies. It routinely calls for asset divestments, as it did at Hess, Suncor Energy and Marathon Petroleum.But another link is the firm’s opposition to traditional energy companies owning renewable businesses.Elliott has run one campaign where it supported greater renewables deployment, at a company called Evergy in 2020. The trend has been in the other direction, however.At NRG Energy and BP, the activist has pushed for the offloading of renewable businesses — moves that align with the political leanings of Elliott’s founder, Paul Singer, according to people who know him. Others insist the campaigns have nothing to do with personal politics.One former Elliott employee said: “They believe the energy transition . . . is expensive and time-consuming.” A recent letter to investors said the “net zero” agenda imposed “massive costs” and acted as a “drag on growth”.Until recently, this view went against the prevailing wind, where big fund managers encouraged oil majors to push further into renewables and reduce carbon emissions.But since Elliott’s large stake in BP became public in February, the UK oil major has already changed course. Its chair Helge Lund has announced plans to step down, the company has pledged to speed up its pivot away from renewables, and it has fast-tracked $20bn of asset divestments. It has also promised to increase investment in oil and gas by 25 per cent.The Philipps 66 refinery in Los Angeles © Mario Tama/Getty Images Elliott wants more. Earlier this week, the hedge fund upped its stake past 5 per cent, and has told the UK energy company that it wants it to boost free cash flow to $20bn by 2027 by more aggressively controlling costs and capital expenditure, according to people familiar with discussions.Changing the course of the roughly £57bn oil major will be no mean feat.“In Europe, board changes are much more difficult,” said Christopher Kuplent, an analyst at Bank of America. “And if you look at the campaigns where [Elliott] have not been able to effect board changes, they have failed.”“BP is the lowest-quality supermajor oil company . . . there is no quick fix,” said Per Lekander, managing partner at hedge fund Clean Energy Transition.Back at Phillips 66, Elliott’s 17-month campaign is reaching a denouement.Unless one side blinks, shareholders will next month choose between the four directors proposed by Elliott and the ones put up by Phillips 66 in a full-blown proxy vote: a Rubicon that Elliott has never crossed against a major US corporation. Phillips 66 this week raised the stakes with a letter to shareholders accusing Elliott of being conflicted due to its pursuit of a rival, Citgo.Success for Elliott increases the likelihood of asset sales, including the company’s midstream business and its chemicals joint venture with Chevron, as well as a shake-up of the management team.Phillips 66 has been Pike’s most combustible campaign since he took on Hess, his maiden campaign in the energy sector that settled just hours before a shareholder vote.Although Elliott went quiet on Hess after just a year, the investor held on to its position there for the best part of a decade before finally cashing out.Taking the fight to Phillips 66 and BP may require the same patience.Rich Kruger, who was installed as Suncor Energy’s chief executive in 2023, a year after Elliott took a stake, said the activist sometimes gave voice to what other investors were thinking.Suncor’s shares gained as much as 41 per cent from when the activist first unveiled its demands in April 2022 and their high in November last year.“I’ve had a lot of hallelujahs from my long-term shareholders about Elliott’s strategy,” he said. “Maybe they’re a little bit more patient and less aggressive than Elliott, but I think they look for the same outcomes.”Additional reporting by Tom Wilson.

    "title": "Why Kashmir is a point of tension between India and Pakistan",
    "time": "2 hours ago | Updated 13:37",
    "content": "Relatives mourn Adil Hussain Shah, a worker in Kashmir, who died when militants indiscriminately opened fire on a crowd of mainly tourists on Tuesday © Dar Yasin/AP A deadly attack on civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir has threatened to reignite one of Asia’s longest-running conflicts after New Delhi linked the violence to Pakistan, feeding fears of a renewed confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Twenty-six people were killed and 17 wounded on Tuesday when suspected militants opened fire in Pahalgam, a scenic tourism destination in the mountainous northern region.The disputed Kashmir valley has been plagued by deadly violence for decades, though relative calm in recent years has brought tourism and economic development.The attack has sparked an outpouring of nationalist fervour, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi warning that those behind the “heinous act” would “not be spared”.Observers fear an escalation could renew the region’s decades-long legacy of militant violence, or even spark direct hostilities between India and Pakistan, as following incidents in 2016 and 2019. Both countries claim Kashmir and each controls parts of the region.Who was behind the latest attack?Two days after the attack, New Delhi has not said who it believes was responsible. However, a new militant group that identifies itself as The Resistance Force (TRF) claimed responsibility for the assault in a statement shared on social media channels on Tuesday.The group has been active in the Kashmir valley over the past four years, where they have claimed credit for ambushing Indian troops. The group has recorded their attacks with body cameras and uploaded the videos to social media, as part of their objective of attacking Indian “occupation” forces.Kashmir has a history of militant activity, including by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group that seeks to reunify the region and was responsible for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 175 people.The group has been banned as a terrorist group by India, the US, UK and EU for its ties to al-Qaeda.What is the political situation in Kashmir?India and Pakistan first went to war over control of Kashmir in 1948, less than a year after the partition that created both independent countries. The boundary between their troops became a de facto border, known as the Line of Control.During the hostilities, the UN Security Council called for a plebiscite for Kashmir residents to decide whether they wanted to join India or Pakistan, but this was never held.The Indian controlled half of the region, known as Jammu and Kashmir, became the country’s only Muslim-majority state, a designation under which it enjoyed partial autonomy, including its own constitution and flag. Jammu refers to the Hindu-majority subregion.In the late 1980s, a separatist movement in Kashmir, backed by Pakistan, turned violent and the militancy peaked in the 1990s with a surge in bombings, kidnappings and attacks on military personnel and civilians.Indian forces responded with heavy-handed repression, and human rights groups have accused New Delhi of forced disappearances and other abuses.What has changed under Modi?Following his re-election in 2019, Modi stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special autonomous status. The move dissolved the legislature and downgraded the region from a state to a federally controlled territory, bringing it under New Delhi’s direct rule.Modi, whose domestic popularity rests in part on a hardline national security stance, promised the changes would bring peace to a region scarred by decades of bloodshed.It also carved out Ladakh — a largely Buddhist mountainous plateau that is claimed and partly controlled by China — as a separate territory.The Jammu and Kashmir move was accompanied by a security crackdown, with authorities imprisoning thousands of people, including local political leaders. It also worsened India-Pakistan relations, leading the countries to downgrade diplomatic and economic ties and sever direct flights.But Modi’s crackdown also brought a lull in the worst of the violence. Kashmir, which is often compared to Switzerland for its rolling green slopes surrounded by snow-peaked mountains, began to draw domestic tourists, with visitor numbers growing to 23.6mn last year from 16.2mn in 2019.The prime minister touted the rising tourism numbers as vindication of his policies, which he said had brought prosperity to the valley.What will happen next?Tourists began fleeing the region on Tuesday, with Indian authorities and airlines organising extra flights. While there have been several militant attacks in the region since 2019, incidents targeting civilians have been rare.India Business Briefing The Indian professional’s must-read on business and policy in the world’s fastest-growing big economy. Sign up for the newsletter here India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh vowed a swift response against the perpetrators as well as those who “conspired behind the scenes”. He did not mention Pakistan, but Indian political figures called for Modi’s government to retaliate.Pakistan’s foreign ministry said it was “concerned” by the tourists’ deaths.India also downgraded diplomatic relations with Pakistan on Wednesday, suspended its participation in a cross-border water treaty and said it would expel Pakistani military advisers and draw down its own personnel.Analysts warned that New Delhi could even take military action. In 2019, after an attack on a paramilitary convoy in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 40, Indian warplanes conducted bombing raids across the border. Indian forces also conducted cross-border raids in 2016 after a gunman killed 19 troops at an army base at Uri in Kashmir.“The suspension of the water treaty is unprecedented in its severity,” said Ajai Sahni, a counterterrorism export and executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi. “It will certainly be followed by other measures, but they will be keeping any plans close to their chest.”"

The market is also popular with institutional investors such as pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds.The launch comes despite market uncertainty in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff blitz, as the California-based group aims to exploit the European market as competition for investor money in the US intensifies.The fund will be run by some of the group’s most senior fund managers, including chief investment officer Dan Ivascyn.Pimco and Luxembourg’s regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), both declined to comment.Even before the recent market volatility, there have been signs that investors have become more wary about investing in the private credit market, which has grown rapidly in recent years.Barclays’ New York-based private credit partner, AGL Credit Management, has had difficulty raising additional capital for its fund other than from its main backer, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.Excluding the commitment from Adia, which has backed AGL since its launch in 2019, the fund had attracted less than $70mn of capital from other investors through the first quarter, filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show.Funds allowing access to private credit remain rare in Europe, although Blackstone launched a similar vehicle in October 2022.The industry is better-established in the US. In February, Apollo Management and State Street launched an exchange-traded fund which will be able to invest directly in much more illiquid private credit assets.The Pimco fund will focus on European asset-based credit, buying debt backed by inventory or property. This is expected to represent about 70-80 per cent of its private asset portfolio.Pimco is a large investor in the private asset-based credit market with $162bn under management in alternative credit and private strategies globally.Asset managers have also pushed to open up access to other forms of relatively illiquid debt.In September Fair Oaks, a specialist corporate credit manager, launched the first European-domiciled ETF investing in collateralised loan obligations, vehicles which in turn hold so-called leveraged loans."

    "content": "Revolut is seeking to expand its ranks of paying subscribers © Bloomberg Profits at Europe’s most valuable start-up more than doubled in 2024 as it added 15mn customers Revolut more than doubled its profits to £1bn last year, as Europe’s most valuable start-up surpassed 50mn customers and benefited from a surge in cryptocurrency trading.In an annual report published on Thursday, Revolut said its pre-tax profits had increased from £438mn a year earlier. Revenues rose to £3.1bn, from £1.8bn.Revolut’s record profits were underpinned by growth in customer numbers, which boosted its two largest sources of revenue: the fees it makes from card payments, and the interest it earns on deposit. It said it added almost 15mn new customers last year.Founder and chief executive Nik Storonsky said “2024 was a landmark year for Revolut” of a year in which the London-based company secured a banking licence in its home market and a $45bn valuation.“But we’re just getting started,” he said, adding that the company was now targeting 100mn daily active customers across 100 countries.A surge in crypto trading also helped the fintech last year. Revolut’s wealth business, which comprises stock and digital asset trading — brought in £506mn in revenues — a nearly fourfold increase on 2023.The division lifted Revolut to its first annual profit in 2021 when retail traders were rushing to get a slice of a crypto boom. However, the company’s revenues from crypto deflated the following year.Although Revolut has attracted millions of customers to its sleek mobile app, the fintech still faces a significant challenge in convincing them to use it for their primary bank account. Gathering a critical mass of deposits is a crucial part of the company’s plan to unlock funding for loans and compete with the largest retail banks.Revolut’s total customer balances rose from £18bn to £30bn during the year. The company — which reported a £979mn loan book that includes credit cards and buy-now-pay-later products — secured a UK banking licence with restrictions in July last year.The licence, obtained after a protracted three-year process with UK regulators, represented a milestone that will enable Revolut to roll out lending products in its home market. Revolut has said it is testing mortgages internally.The company is also seeking to expand its ranks of paying subscribers. Revenue from fees on premium subscription plans, which offer a range of perks, rose 74 per cent year on year to £423mn. It has also targeted corporate customers, with its business offering now accounting for about 15 per cent of revenues."

    "title": "Donald Trump’s tariffs choke vital medical device supply chain",
    "time": "4 hours ago",
    "content": "© FT montage; Getty Images Industry warns that trade disruption will raise prices for hospitals Medical device makers have raised the alarm over a potential supply chain crunch and higher prices for hospitals around the world because of the disruption from the US-China trade stand-off.Experts said the industry’s highly integrated global supply chains, which can see a single device drawing parts from more than 20 different countries, had left the industry highly exposed to a global tariff war.Graphic illustrating how a typical medical infusion pump manufactured in the US can contain parts from more than 20 other countries by breaking down types of parts by the country the suppliers are from The sector’s main US lobby, representing makers of devices ranging from MRI scanners to glucose monitors, has warned of severe consequences for the health sector if the industry is not shielded from tariffs as it had been in Donald Trump’s first term as US president.The need for regulatory approvals for individual components used in medical devices — ranging from highly complex diagnostic scanners with hundreds of parts to simple items such as surgical gloves and gowns — also constrained the ability of manufacturers to reconfigure supply chains.Ten major US health tech lobby groups this month jointly called on the Trump administration to provide exemptions for the fast-growing industry, which is estimated to be worth more than $200bn a year in the US, according to market research groups. The lobbies represent large global manufacturers, including Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson.“We are concerned that tariffs placed on medical and dental equipment threaten to disrupt the supply chain and raise costs for these critical items,” they wrote in a letter this month to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.Supply chain experts said US manufacturers were most immediately at risk from the Trump administration’s 145 per cent tariffs on imports from China, which is a critical source of parts, including medical-grade polymers, metals and circuit boards.The global industry is also facing the threat of “reciprocal” US tariffs on the EU and other components supplier countries in south-east Asia, which are on a 90-day pause pending negotiations with the Trump administration.“US-based medical device manufacturers are, for now, the most at risk here,” said Heiko Schwarz, adviser at Sphera, the global supply chain risk management consultancy, citing US reliance on China for parts in items such as MRI scanners.“China is the world’s second-largest exporter of MRI parts, a cornerstone technology in modern diagnostics. Tariffs on these imports could lead to substantial cost increases for US healthcare providers and patients alike,” he added.China, India and south-east Asia are also important suppliers and refiners of medical-grade polymers, such as polypropylene and polyethylene, and high-grade metals such as titanium and stainless steel, used in implants and surgical tools.“As the US raises tariffs on European exports and China imposes retaliatory measures, the flow of these materials is likely to slow or become more expensive,” Schwarz said, adding that tariffs could lead to “substantial cost” increases for American healthcare providers.For manufacturers of high-value medical devices in Europe, such as surgical robots, even the 10% global tariff imposed by the Trump administration has the potential to make it harder to be competitive in US markets © Stephen Bond/CMR Legal experts said that while medical devices were not covered by the 1994 World Trade Organization agreement that exempts pharmaceuticals from tariffs, most medical devices from China were exempted from tariffs imposed in Trump’s first term since they were essential items.Chandri Navarro, senior counsel in the international trade practice at Washington DC law firm Baker McKenzie, said tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada would impact a broad range of devices, including medical imaging and diagnostic equipment.At the same time, she warned, the EU had included a range of medical device products from the US, including surgical gowns, stockings for varicose veins, respiratory face masks and contact lenses, on its list of products for potential retaliatory tariffs. Those countermeasures are on hold following Trump’s decision to pause “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days.“The newly imposed tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada do affect medical devices. Many medical devices are manufactured in these countries and the tariffs can lead to increased costs and potential shortages,” she wrote.Stephen Aherne, pharmaceuticals and life sciences leader at consultancy PwC, said reworking supply chains to avoid tariffs was complicated by the fact that any newly sourced parts required fresh regulatory approvals that were costly and time-consuming.“Building alternative manufacturing capabilities takes time and requires a huge amount of effort, in terms of regulatory burdens, so a lot of companies are having to wait and see how things pan out,” he added.A single MRI system made by a large manufacturer typically has 252 parts, sourced from 15 different countries, including China, the US and Europe, according to AdvaMed, the main US medical technology trade association.“Each part, as well as the site where it’s made and the skills of the workers, are all registered and certified as part of the regulatory approval process. Any change to a single part or site requires an updated regulatory approval process.“It’s this combination of a global supply chain and the regulated environment that make it particularly difficult to make rapid changes to a manufacturing process in the medical device industry,” the group said.A full-blown tariff war between the US and China would also hurt American manufacturers looking to expand sales into China, according to Prashant Yadav, healthcare supply chains expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.“China is a big growing market for hospital devices. The US market is pretty saturated, since all hospitals have X-ray and scanners already, but China is buying new med tech and machines because it’s building large numbers of new hospitals,” he said.For parts coming the other way, from China to the US, Yadav said many manufacturers had buffer stocks of parts but prices would start to rise if the stand-off between the US and China was prolonged.“A large diagnostics business might have 10,000 suppliers, of which more than 50 per cent might typically be in China and so potentially subject to import tariffs. Manufacturers will have buffer stocks, but when they get exhausted, then prices will go up.”For manufacturers of high-value medical devices in Europe, such as surgical robots, even the 10 per cent global tariff imposed by the Trump administration has the potential to make it harder to be competitive in US markets.Cambridge-based CMR Surgical, a maker of surgical robots, won regulatory approval last October from the US Food and Drug Administration for use of its Versius system that is used in procedures such as gall bladder removal.As a result of Trump’s tariffs, the company now faces a 10 per cent tariff on exports to the US on machines that cost about £1mn, while American competitors are able to export tariff-free to the UK after the British government elected not to retaliate against the US.CMR said in a statement that its US strategy remained unchanged and it remained committed to entering the American market, but added it was “closely monitoring trade developments and assessing any potential impact”."

    "content": "Xiaomi has showcased its SU7 Ultra electric vehicle at the Shanghai Auto Show but has not unveiled its new SUV © Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Fatal Xiaomi EV crash led to regulator stepping in ahead of splashy launches at Shanghai show Carmakers have been forced to tone down their promotion of autonomous driving functions in new models unveiled at this week’s Shanghai automotive show after a safety crackdown by Beijing.Advertising the self-driving capabilities of electric vehicles has been curbed following a fatal car crash last month — involving a Xiaomi SU7 smart car — that has fuelled debate over the roadworthiness of such technology.Xiaomi had said its Navigate on Autopilot autonomous driving function had been activated before the accident on a Chinese expressway that killed three young women inside the SU7, its first EV model.Its founder Lei Jun said he was “heavy-hearted” and acknowledged the public criticism that ensued. Xiaomi has been co-operating with police investigating the cause of the crash.The accident also ended expectations that Xiaomi, a consumer electronics maker that made a spectacular EV debut a year ago, would follow up by unveiling the YU7, its first electric SUV, at China’s biggest car show.Xiaomi’s charismatic founder, who attracts huge crowds at corporate events, is skipping the Auto Shanghai show, although the company insisted on Wednesday that the launch date for the YU7 is unchanged, “staying between June and July as anticipated by founder Lei”.China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the country’s top automotive regulator, summoned around 60 representatives from major carmakers for discussions last week where it warned them against exaggerating the capabilities of their assisted driving functions.“Automakers . . . must effectively enhance the safety level of intelligent connected vehicle products,” it said in a statement after the meeting.The regulatory pressure comes amid intense competition among local players in China to develop such systems, with foreign rivals including Tesla and Mercedes-Benz also scrambling to keep up with the pace of innovation in the world’s largest car market.China’s tighter regulations have affected the marketing language that carmakers have been using at the Shanghai show, with many emphasising their safety features.“We need to be super paranoid about . . . what we’ve achieved,” said Giovanni Lanfranchi, chief executive of Zeekr Technology Europe, at a roundtable interview on Tuesday. “Safety is very important.”Mercedes emphasized drivers were required to stay engaged all the time even though it had developed a “handy and reliable” advanced driver assistance systems (Adas) platform, its China head Oliver Thöne said at a launch event for its new CLA L model in Shanghai.“Part of the [industry ministry] directive, as we read it, was a call to action to the original equipment manufacturers to clean up the communication,” Mercedes chief executive Ola Källenius told reporters.“We welcome the government’s tightening of the regulations over the [Adas sector],” said Nio chief executive William Li at a roundtable on Tuesday.“Safety is number one for Volkswagen,” CEO Oliver Blume said on the eve of Auto Shanghai, while defending inevitable shortcomings in the emerging Adas technology. “You will never have a system with zero defects,” he said.Huawei, along with a state-backed regulatory body and 11 car manufacturers, also launched a joint initiative. Jin Yuzhi, head of Huawei's car unit, called on the industry to “eliminate false advertising, clearly define the boundaries . . . of smart driving functions and build user trust”.Huawei launched an upgraded version of its Adas platform on Tuesday, featuring a collision prevention system and assistance in the case of tyre blowouts or driver incapacity.Several carmakers and developers of self-driving solutions, including Huawei and Audi’s joint venture with its Chinese partner FAW, have changed their “smart driving” description to more cautious wording, such as “combination assisted driving”, during recent media events.Last week, BYD requested domestic media outlets and car influencers should avoid using terms such as “God’s Eye”— the original name of its self-driving system — or functions such as “valet parking”, according to people who received the memo.On Monday, two industry associations published a petition urging carmakers to educate users on the “fundamental difference” between “driver assistance” and “self-driving”.Under current Chinese regulations, drivers bear full responsibility for traffic accidents involving vehicles equipped with Level 2 driving features, which can assist with simple tasks such as steering, acceleration and braking, but require drivers to remain fully attentive at all times.For Level 3 vehicles, managing more complex scenarios but still requiring drivers to be ready to take control upon a system prompt, responsibility is shared among drivers, insurers and carmakers."

Mary Rasenberger, a former copyright and media lawyer who is now chief executive of The Authors Guild, says “we have never before had that level of agreement among our membership on any issue”.The challenge of AI has also brought together publishers and agents. Esmond Harmsworth, president of the literary agency Aevitas, says: “Since the author and the publisher could easily be replaced [by AI] it’s been a more pleasant negotiation and one in which we join forces to try to come up with solutions to this.” Agents are now insisting on clauses in book contracts to control the future training of LLMs on authors’ work or, in some cases, license its use for a fee.But AI is also an opportunity. The same engines offer automated assistance to authors in brainstorming and researching ideas, or editing and reviewing what they have written.Olson says she still “can’t see any model being able to generate text that could replace my own writing”. She says the prose of Gen AI is “bland” and that “it will always be soul-destroying to not write in your own voice”.Using LLMs for research, as Olson does, falls well within guidelines for responsible and effective use of AI, produced for authors last month by Wiley, which publishes academic works, textbooks and general business books.Josh Jarrett, Wiley’s senior vice-president for AI growth, says the assumption was writers were “going to use these tools anyway and we need to find the right place on that continuum”, which could start with widespread tools such as spellcheck and Grammarly and, unchecked, run to automated drafting of whole books.The guidance, assembled after surveying 5,000 authors and researchers, states the technology should be used “as a companion to [the] writing process, not a replacement”. It lays out when authors should disclose AI use — for example, when the tool “altered [their] thinking on key arguments or conclusions”. Wiley allows for the use of AI to prepare “educational content”, such as case studies and practice questions, with oversight and disclosure. Its guide is a “living document”, says Jarrett, which will evolve as the technology develops.There are signs AI is working its way deeper into the writing process, not least OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman’s announcement on social media platform X last month that an as yet unreleased model was “good at creative writing”.Serious publishers and agents take a hard line against the use of AI to write whole books — but some are experimenting. Wiley tried to produce its manual Generative AI For Dummies using the technology. Jarrett says while it was useful for drafting chapter headings, it “didn’t actually save much time”. Wiley says generative AI could be used to develop new formats, such as a concise edition of a heavyweight textbook.Executive coach Marshall Goldsmith has an AI avatar that responds to questions by drawing on his prior work, including his bestseller What Got You Here Won’t Get You There. When asked whether the technology was useful for coaching, MarshallGoldsmith.ai responded that the best outcome combines both human and machine: “It’s a both/and proposition, not either/or.”James Levine, principal at agency Levine Greenberg Rostan, says the biggest emerging threat is in the spoken, rather than written word, as “several publishers are now experimenting with the use of AI to record audiobooks”. On the other hand, Harmsworth points out that the rapid recording of material that might otherwise never be made available in audio form could be a boon for visually impaired readers.Kevin Anderson, chief executive of book-writing service Kevin Anderson & Associates, believes AI will hit ghostwriters at the lower to middle range of the sector. They are typically paid $25,000-$50,000 for 18 months’ work on a book that will raise a business leader or celebrity’s profile. Anderson points out AI could put together an adequate how-to book that is “generic, comprehensive, well written and well organised” in a weekend.At the top end of the profession, where his agency recently sealed a ghostwriting deal worth nearly $500,000, Anderson says it is harder for machines to replace humans. “Generating content isn’t necessarily the part that humans do better than AI. It’s figuring out what the content should be and being that interviewer, using their human intuition to . . . figure out how to get [the story] out of the person the right way,” he says.Even if some authors do not yet use AI, their agents and publishers almost certainly do. Springer Nature this month introduced a tool to fight AI-generated fake research and identify irrelevant references in its book and journal submissions. Levine uses specialist AI “personas” to help critique incoming book proposals on technical subjects, although he only does so with authors’ permission and using models that are not trained on the input.The technology is advancing fast. “Already we are seeing a large decline in some of the side jobs that authors have done to supplement book income — including copy writing, business writing and some journalism; and now they see AI-generated books competing with their own and in some cases using their text or identities,” warns Rasenberger.Harmsworth reckons the models have not yet caught up with talented writers. But “the big question that we have all been worried about is how long is that going to last”.For more on the FT and Schroders Business Book of the Year Award 2025, visit www.ft.com/bookaward and https://businessbook.live.ft.com/"
